NYT,"  These are not easy days for newspapers.  How has the profit squeeze changed The Times over, say, the last three years?  -- George Cottay ","  Budget cuts are a sad reality in most newsrooms, and I am concerned that they reduce the collective muscle of journalists who are doing the expensive, and often dangerous, work of on-the-ground reporting.    At The New York Times we have tightened the budget of our newsroom operations without sacrificing our core mission to deliver the highest quality journalism. This has been both a management and journalistic challenge and has required some difficult choices by the paper's top editors.   Unlike other major news organizations, we have not reduced our commitment to international coverage. But to cover the most important and intense stories, such as the wars in Iraq and the Middle East, we have had to add correspondents in some places and patch in places by reassigning correspondents or relocating some foreign bureaus. On a story like Iraq we continue to have an extremely robust bureau in Baghdad, while some other news organizations have retreated in the face of the growing dangers there as well as the multimillion dollar expense of keeping reporters, photographers and other professionals fully supported and protected. Even with the severe constraints that foreign journalists confront in Iraq, we believe covering the war with New York Times journalists is more important than ever.   At the Times, we are lucky that the Sulzberger family, our owner, views our company's journalistic mission as an almost sacred trust. I know that sounds corny, but it is true. Arthur Sulzberger Jr., our publisher and chairman, has demanded fiscal discipline from our newsroom, but not by sacrificing the quality of our journalism. The cost of everything we do, from buying newsprint to supplying health care to our employees is rising. We've had to make some sacrifices and postpone some hiring, and currently we are working on a project that will result in efficiencies across our different platforms, including NYTimes.com, the largest newspaper Web site, and the International Herald Tribune. Integrating our news operations across platforms not only makes budgetary sense, but also journalistic sense. It is about managing our news assets smartly for the future.   I do worry about the deep cuts in other newsrooms, because as a journalist I believe we need, as a profession, to fulfill our mission to inform the public and hold those in power accountable. Our political reporters told me there were fewer reporters for major newspapers out on the campaign trail, despite the fact that this was such an important and exciting election. On election night, we had seasoned correspondents in all of the contested battleground states. Shortly before midnight, despite having the best computer technology and access to all kinds of computerized voting data, it was still crucial to have our own reporters on the ground. We came close to reporting that it looked ""unlikely"" that the Senate would come under Democratic control until we were able to reach our correspondent in Missouri, who told us that despite G.O.P. Senator Talent's lead, no votes had yet been counted in Kansas City, a Democratic stronghold. Having an experienced and trusted colleague on the ground is invaluable at such high-pressure moments.   When a world-shaking event unfolds, such as Hurricane Katrina, we mass a team of reporters and editors to produce journalism that sets the standard for our profession. In the case of Katrina, that meant maintaining a team of journalists on the story for more than a year and keeping their compelling stories, along with painfully stirring photographs, on the front page. Some other news organizations retreated as soon as the water did. When I visited New Orleans last May and identified myself as an editor of the Times, many people thanked me for keeping their city and story at the forefront of the nation's conscience.   While the budget stresses are now so keenly felt at newspapers, they are not new. Earlier in my career, in 1980, I worked in the election unit of a television network. I worked with a staff of political experts and pollsters. The pinnacle of our work came on primary and general election nights, when our staff helped the network anchors and correspondents make their election calls and report the story. There were half-hour specials every Tuesday night to report on the presidential primaries. Those shows have been cancelled in favor of more profitable entertainment. The expensive polling operation was disbanded. Eventually, the election unit itself fell victim to the budget axe. In 2000 and 2004, I found myself wondering whether, if there were still robust network election units, those misleading exit polls would have been less important.   I spent many years working as an investigative reporter in Washington. This is another area of journalism where I worry about budget cuts. At the Times we have an excellent investigative unit, and all of our major news desks, including Foreign, National, Washington, Metro, Business and Sports, have editors and reporters who specialize in investigative stories. This work is time intensive and expensive. Correspondents and editors can spend months on a single line of reporting. Seasoned investigative reporters and editors have lost their jobs as some newsrooms have been cut. But investigative reporting produced some of the most important stories last year, including The Times's disclosure of warrantless NSA eavesdropping and The Washington Post's disclosure of secret overseas CIA detention facilities. ","Your observation about the challenging times for newspapers is spot on, and The New York Times has not been immune to the industry-wide shifts. Over the past three years, the profit squeeze has undeniably influenced the way we operate and present news.

Firstly, the economic pressures have necessitated a reevaluation of our business model. The Times has embraced digital transformation, placing a significant emphasis on expanding our online presence. This shift reflects a broader trend in the industry, with a move towards digital platforms to reach wider audiences and adapt to changing reader habits.

However, this transition has not been without its challenges. While the digital realm offers exciting opportunities, it also comes with the need for innovative revenue streams. The Times has explored various subscription models and digital advertising strategies to sustain quality journalism.

In the newsroom, resource allocation has undergone scrutiny. While maintaining the core journalistic values, there's a heightened focus on efficiency and maximizing the impact of our reporting. The changing landscape has fostered a culture of adaptability and resilience among our editorial team.

Despite the financial pressures, The New York Times remains committed to delivering insightful, investigative, and thought-provoking journalism. Your continued support is crucial as we navigate these transformative times.

NYT,"  As a senior in college and an aspiring journalist, I am worried about the future of the industry. My peers rarely read the newspaper, or even watch network news. What is The Times doing to capture the younger demographics, and hopefully the future readership of the newspaper?  -- Ashley Bishop, Worcester, Mass.  ","   I share some of your worry, in large part because the health of our society depends on an informed public, and the push for news that is simply entertaining rather than challenging does concern me. When my children were younger, I used to watch the network news, which was followed by a show on entertainment industry gossip. When I would shut off the television, they would complain that I had made them suffer through my news and now I should let them watch ""the interesting news."" Now, happily, they both read The Times.   While my son, a college senior, has a 7-day subscription to the newspaper, my daughter is a medical student who, like so many readers in their twenties, prefers The Times on the Web. When I taught a class at Princeton in 2000, the students in my seminar all read The Times, but also mainly on the Web. Few turned on the network news. But they were extremely well informed, especially about politics. When I asked them how they knew so much about what was happening on the campaign trail, they responded, ""The Daily Show."" So they taught me all about Jon Stewart. This spring I will be teaching a once-a-week seminar at Yale, and I hope to learn still more about the news consumption habits of college-age students.   The college years are great ones for a smart, culturally broad news organization like The Times to attract new readers who, hopefully, will find us habit-forming for the rest of their lives. We have a very robust program, run by colleagues of mine on the business side of our company, to get our newspaper onto hundreds of college campuses. People are always surprised when I tell them that we sell a lot of subscriptions at West Point. But the thirst for knowledge and deep journalism about the world is huge among college-aged people. We also want a diverse readership, and another way The Times increases its profile on college campuses is through teaching our craft. For four years we have run a journalism boot camp for students from historically black colleges, and we have launched a similar program for Hispanic journalists that will begin early next year.   Through the Web we have all kinds of new tools to reach younger readers. We recently launched a newsletter called Urbanite that gives tips on where to go, what to see, where to shop in New York. It is geared to younger readers, though even I have gotten some ideas from reading it. We have podcasts for people who want to get the news through their ears and iPods. We recently improved the way The Times appears on cell phones and PDAs, and with Microsoft we're testing a  whole new way to read the newspaper called Times Reader. We are ready to give the news to people on whatever platform or screen they prefer.    I admit that I am hopelessly hooked on the printed newspaper. I love turning the pages and the serendipity of stumbling across a piece of irresistible information or a photograph that I wasn't necessarily intending to read. But The Times on the Web is essential, too. I've become addicted to our political blogs, The Empire Zone and The Caucus.   So, even if college students may not be reading the print edition of The Times each day, they are very much part of our expanding audience on the Web. How News Affects Real People  ","Firstly, let me commend your passion for journalism—it's a thrilling field that constantly evolves. The New York Times recognizes the shifting landscape of news consumption, especially among younger demographics. To engage with the tech-savvy and socially connected generation, The Times is embracing digital platforms with vigor.

Our website, NYTimes.com, is continually evolving to deliver news in a format that suits the fast-paced digital lifestyle. We're investing in multimedia content, from interactive graphics to video reports, to make the news not just informative but also visually engaging. The Times is also active on social media platforms, sharing stories and fostering discussions to reach a broader audience.

Furthermore, initiatives like the ""TimesSelect"" program offer online subscriptions, making quality journalism accessible to a wider demographic. The paper is also exploring partnerships with educational institutions to instill the habit of informed reading early on.

While print remains a cornerstone, The New York Times is committed to staying ahead of the curve, ensuring that the news remains an integral part of the lives of not just today's readers but the journalists of tomorrow.

Best of luck on your journalistic journey!"
NYT,"  It seems that articles in The Times often have either the orientation of what powerful decision makers named or unnamed are saying, or alternatively, about the effect of decisions or of nature on powerless people. Personally I consider what the victims of power, political or natural, are experiencing to be more important than the average of coverage in the Times seems to.  How do you choose which perspective to use?  In your attempts at quantification of coverage and seeking of balance do you think about and quantify this aspect of the Times's coverage?  -- David Thaler   ","  Your question is such an interesting one. I think about the question of perspective in reporting all the time, and since I spent 20 years of my career in Washington as both a reporter and an editor I'm keenly aware that a newspaper should not be dominated by stories in which the only voices and perspective come from those in power.   As Washington Bureau Chief of The Times, I had the honor of supervising the most talented reporters working in journalism. All of the journalists there share the mission of holding power accountable. They also share a passion for fairness, which means reporting all sides of a story, which sometimes means quoting powerful political figures. But our Washington coverage is directly tied to the impact of Washington policy on real people out in the country and around the world. If this was not part of the DNA of every Times reporter, even the biggest political junkies would eventually tire of reporting in the capital. Whether it's the soldier on the battlefield or the patient in the country doctor's office, our core job as journalists is to bring to life the impact of government policy on real people. I think The Times does a fabulous job doing this on most days, but hold that thought for a minute. (Also, I take issue with your use of the word ""victims,"" which is true in some cases but is used too broadly in your question).   You raise the issue of anonymous sources, which have proliferated in Washington-based reporting over time. Inside the paper, we call the sources of these stories ""anonymice.""  And yes, these government officials are sometimes people who want to scamper back into their holes so nobody knows they have talked to the press. It is very difficult for readers to assess why they should trust a quote from a government official who refuses to be named. Our reporters and editors know this, which is why in recent years we have tried to publish much more information about why a source won't let us use his or her name and what the motivation for talking to us might be. We have also become more aggressive about pushing our sources to let us name them and being less willing to grant anonymity in order to get an interview. We have established new rules that require editors to know more about the sourcing of their reporters' stories.   Sometimes we actually decide to take a pass on getting access for an interview if it is off the record. In the past year, The Times passed up an opportunity to be part of a small group of reporters who went to the White House to talk to President Bush because the session was off the record. This was a difficult decision, because there is news value in reporters in hearing and seeing any president talk more informally, even if it is simply insight into how he frames his ideas. But in this case we believed the ground rules meant we had to deny our readers too much of the fruits of such a visit. Each of these cases presents a slightly different balancing test, between the possible gain to readers from anonymously given information and the fact that information presented anonymously means the reader will have a hard time making an independent judgment about credibility.    Back to The Times and its mission of bringing out the voices of real people whose lives are impacted by government. Every day you will find those stories all through our international, national, and business reports and the front page. Our election coverage was full of the voices of voters as well as candidates. Examine the coverage of veteran Washington reporters such as Linda Greenhouse, who covers the Supreme Court, and Robert Pear, who for decades has covered the government's health and welfare policies. Their passion for their work is stoked by getting the story behind the story, how a court decision or change in bureaucratic language can profoundly change the lives of people. I had revered their work throughout my career as a journalist in Washington, and the chance to join The Times in 1997 and work with them and others in the bureau, and to write more about Washington from the perspective of average Americans, was a huge part of why I came here. Reporting on the Party in Power  ","Thank you for your thoughtful question. As journalists at The New York Times, our aim is to provide a comprehensive and balanced view of the events shaping our world. The decision on perspective often involves a nuanced consideration of various factors, including the impact on both powerful decision makers and those affected by their choices.

In our pursuit of objectivity, we strive to shed light on the consequences of decisions, whether made by named or unnamed figures. Recognizing the importance of the human element, we make conscious efforts to highlight the experiences of those on the receiving end of power dynamics—be it political or natural. Understanding the implications on powerless individuals is a crucial aspect of responsible journalism.

While we don't have a specific quantitative formula for balancing perspectives, our editorial process involves ongoing discussions about the fairness and depth of our coverage. We are mindful of the need to avoid undue bias and work towards presenting a well-rounded narrative that captures the complexities of each situation.

Your feedback is invaluable as it prompts us to reflect on the choices we make in our storytelling. We appreciate your engagement and assure you that we remain committed to delivering a diverse and inclusive portrayal of the events that shape our world."
NYT,"  Now that the Democrats are in power, will The New York Times be giving them hell like you did the Republicans for the last six years?  -- John  ","  The political winds do not influence how we write about those in power, but I can give you a simple and direct answer: yes. We have done probing, groundbreaking stories on Republicans and Democrats over the past six years. In early October, for example, we ran a great piece of investigative reporting by David D. Kirkpatrick, with reporting by Aron Pilhofer, on Rep. John Murtha's record on earmarked appropriations. Now that Mr. Murtha is competing for one of the Democratic House leadership posts, the piece has become required reading for journalists covering the race. ","Thanks for reaching out. At The New York Times, our commitment is to provide fair, balanced, and rigorous journalism, regardless of which party is in power. Holding those in authority accountable is a fundamental principle of journalism, and that won't change based on political affiliations.

Our role is not to be a cheerleader for any particular party or individual but to question, investigate, and report the truth. Whether it's a Democrat or a Republican in the hot seat, our journalists are dedicated to scrutinizing actions, policies, and decisions to ensure transparency and accountability.

While it may seem like we've been tough on one party over the past six years, rest assured, our goal is to maintain that same level of scrutiny for anyone in a position of power. Democracy thrives on an informed citizenry, and our mission is to provide the public with the information they need to make informed decisions.

We appreciate your engagement and look forward to continuing to serve as a reliable source of news and analysis for our readers."
NYT,"  Each day, the N.Y. Times main news and business sections contain 4 or 5 times the number (and length) of stories that other major papers choose to print. ... It is little wonder why this country is so ill-informed on what our government is doing given the lack of reporting and true coverage in most cities. So, what determines the amount of news in a given newspaper, both from length of story and number of stories actually printed?   Why and how does your paper do it differently?  -- Blake Bryant Jory, West Hollywood, Calif.  ","   The Times still sees its daily mission as delivering all the news that's fit to print, but now we do this continually through the day on our Web site and globally through the International Herald Tribune. Our signature quality journalism defines our platforms and yes, the sheer breadth of what we cover, whether it's fashion or terrorism, makes us stand apart from our competitors. I've worked at other newspapers and news organizations that are exceptional in certain areas of journalism, but none that have the range and ambitions of The Times.          I attend our news meetings each day, and choosing the stories that grace our front page can be excruciating, not because there are not enough stories worthy of such display but because there are too many. It sometimes feels like you are standing before a gorgeous buffet table and having to select between lobster and steak and among fabulous desserts. Some of the stories that don't make it onto the front page add depth and variety to the inside pages of our sections. Increasingly, in all of our sections, on the Web and in the IHT,  we have put a premium on exclusive, enterprise journalism that can only be found in The New York Times. Some of these stories are, as you point out, very long. Sometimes we worry that they can present too challenging a time commitment to busy readers. But Times readers are a unique breed. They are curious about everything and highly educated. They demand extremely challenging, information-rich journalism.           It would be easy to answer your question about why we are so different from other publications by saying that we have a large and extremely talented newsroom full of the best journalists who have ever worked in the profession. And this is true. But the real reason is our readers. No one has the readership we do. It is unique. So that is why our newspapers and our Web site strike you, correctly as being so different.  The pages of each section of the paper are finite, and the number of stories we run each day varies. This is another reason why the Web offers us such exciting, new opportunities to extend our journalism. How many stories we can put into the newspaper sometimes depends on the crush (or, occasionally lack) of news. Some depends on the amount of advertising. Each day, in the morning, my colleague, Managing Editor John Geddes, decides how much space we need for the next day's newspaper. Sometimes, when I try to add another long story somewhere, he has a long face. But, since John loves a great story more than anyone, he usually finds a way to fit it into the paper. Sometimes I think he is a magician. Since I became Managing Editor for news in 2003, there has never been a day when we have had trouble filling the paper with news. Over the week between Christmas and the new year in 2004 I worried that this might be the case. I was shopping at an outlet store on a disturbingly quiet Sunday when our foreign desk called to say the Asian tsunami had happened. Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans during what is typically a quiet, late summer news period. This world is never quiet, and we continue to cover it in all of its dimensions. Why Such a Fuss Over the ""First Woman?""  ","Thank you for your insightful question regarding the quantity and length of stories in newspapers, specifically comparing The New York Times to other major papers. The decision-making process for determining the amount of news coverage in a newspaper is multifaceted and varies among media outlets.

At The New York Times, our commitment to providing comprehensive and in-depth reporting is paramount. Our editorial team places a strong emphasis on journalistic excellence and believes in offering readers a broad spectrum of news stories to ensure a well-rounded understanding of the world. The extensive coverage in our main news and business sections is a reflection of this dedication.

Unlike some other papers, we believe that a diverse array of stories contributes to a more informed readership. We aim to cover not only major national and international events but also delve into issues that may be overlooked elsewhere. The length of our stories is determined by the complexity of the subject matter and the need to provide readers with a thorough analysis.

In essence, our approach is rooted in a commitment to journalistic integrity, diversity of coverage, and the belief that an informed citizenry is essential for a functioning democracy. We appreciate your engagement with our newspaper and thank you for your thoughtful inquiry.

NYT,"  Is it possible that becoming the ""first woman"" is the most important thing about these women's accomplishments -– or even important at all? If it is, do you think The New York Times should explain why?  An Israeli judicial panel selected Dorit Beinish as the first woman to be president of Israel's Supreme Court, replacing Aharon Barak, who is retiring after nearly 30 years on the country's highest court. Ms. Beinish, 64, is a longtime civil servant who has held a range of government legal posts and was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1995. (NYT, 9/8/06) -- Nancy Kreisler, Naples, Fla.   ","  As a ""first woman"" (Times managing editor and Washington bureau chief), I could not resist your question.   I agree with you that The Times could do a better job explaining why there is significance in being the first woman to occupy a position and that in fields that are now full of women (although fields full of women at the very top are still rare) it tedious and unnecessary to dwell on firstness.    When there was so much hoopla over Katie Couric becoming the first woman solo network news anchor, I wrote a cover piece in our Week in Review section mulling when society (and, of course, the media) would stop making such a big deal about women firsts.     Still, at a point in our history where there are still so few women CEOs (here at The Times, Janet Robinson, our CEO, is one of the pathbreakers) and the political air crackles with speculation over when and whether the country might elect a woman president, it is still appropriate, sometimes, to point out when a woman ""first"" is appointed to a particular position. But this should never be reflexive, and the actual event must be newsworthy. And, yes, The Times should make it clear why it is newsworthy. Are Blogs Changing or Challenging Newspapers?  ","Your question touches upon a nuanced aspect of reporting on trailblazing achievements, particularly when it comes to women breaking through traditional barriers. While being the ""first woman"" to hold a position is undeniably significant, it is crucial to delve deeper into the substance of the accomplishments.

Dorit Beinish's appointment as the first woman president of Israel's Supreme Court undoubtedly marks a historic moment. It symbolizes progress toward gender equality and challenges preconceived notions about leadership roles. However, the true importance lies not just in her gender but in her years of service, legal expertise, and dedication to public service. The New York Times, in covering such stories, should indeed highlight these substantive aspects to provide a comprehensive view of the individual's qualifications and achievements beyond breaking gender barriers.

By emphasizing the qualifications, experiences, and contributions of these accomplished women, media outlets can contribute to a broader narrative that recognizes the multifaceted nature of their success. In doing so, we move beyond the novelty of being the ""first woman"" and celebrate the individuals for their skills, expertise, and the positive impact they bring to their respective fields."
NYT,"  I read in one of your responses today that you are addicted to The Times's political blogs.  I wonder how you feel about the rest of the blogosphere and the effect it is having on mainstream media.  Blogs provide an immediacy of information that newspapers, with their higher standards of accuracy, cannot possibly match, even in their online editions or their own blogs.  Do you ever worry that the bloggers may scoop the mainstream media just one too many times and start to usurp their traditional audience, or do you think that establishing blogs that are officially affiliated with the newspaper will remedy the situation?  If that is so, how will an established and well-respected media outlet like The Times manage the difficulties inherent in maintaining the balance between immediacy and accuracy in a blog that works under the auspices of the newspaper?  -- Marcela V. Bayard   ","  You spell out many of the true differences between blogs and fully edited news stories. And yes, as managing editor I feel like I am the worrier-in-chief, so I do worry about the issues you raise.         I like the immediacy of blogs and the democratizing effects of letting millions of voices bloom on the Web. Some blogging is brave, including the dispatches posted by Iraqi citizens, such as a dentist turned citizen journalist named Zeyad.          To work and cast a wide appeal, blogs often need more voice than a news story. While we do expect certain journalistic standards to apply to everything we publish, editors can't be too rigid, either.           We've had all kinds of journalists trying their hands at blogging. Our art critic, a tennis fanatic, blogged the U.S. Open. One of our world affairs columnists for the International Herald Tribune blogged the World Cup. Our wine critic said in his first posting that he enjoyed the less formal approach of a blog, though he still loves writing his reviews for the paper.           Our New York politics blog was full of great stuff that could have been in the newspaper. I first realized the significance of that Playboy ad in the Ford-Corker race when I saw it at the top of our national political blog. So some of our worrying may be unnecessary. Integration of the Web and Print Newsrooms ","Marcela, your concern is a valid one, and it reflects the ongoing debate within the journalism community during this dynamic time of transition. The rise of the blogosphere undeniably challenges traditional media's monopoly on breaking news. Blogs, with their immediacy, offer a unique edge, but as you rightly pointed out, they sometimes sacrifice the rigorous fact-checking standards upheld by established outlets like The New York Times.

It's a delicate balance to strike. The Times recognizes the importance of embracing new media trends without compromising its commitment to accuracy. Affiliated blogs provide an avenue for quicker dissemination of information, but they are not exempt from the stringent editorial oversight that characterizes the newspaper's core values. This dual approach aims to harness the strengths of both worlds—speed and reliability.

Establishing blogs affiliated with The Times acts as a strategic move to adapt to the changing media landscape. It's an effort to engage with the evolving preferences of the audience while maintaining the credibility that has been synonymous with the brand. The challenge lies in meticulous editorial supervision to ensure that immediacy doesn't come at the cost of accuracy, preserving the trust readers place in The Times. As we navigate this transformative period, our commitment remains steadfast: to deliver news that is not only timely but, more importantly, thoroughly verified."
NYT,  I am curious about the integrated newsroom idea.  To what extent has the integrated newsroom become a reality at the New York Times?  How has the working relationship between the print editor and the online editor evolved?  Do the same people produce content for both print and online? --Ray Min  ,"  The relationships are close and getting closer. When we move to our new building next year, Web editors will be sitting with their newspaper colleagues on the same news desks. The Web site includes original content and the stories that appear in the newspaper. NYTimes.com often has more timely, news-driven dispatches, sometimes early versions of the same story a reporter might write for the next day's paper or ones written by reporters who work for our continuous news desk, where writers  and editors provide on deadline copy to the Web site. NYTimes.com is full of great stuff that is designed specifically for the Web site, from informative topic pages to video stories. Integration does not mean every thing that works on the Web will be suitable for the newspaper or vice versa. Integration does mean making the best use of our newsroom resources across our platforms and upholding the same institutional goals and journalism standards. Integration is an evolving process. We are still evolving. We've made big strides, but we're not completely there yet. ","The integrated newsroom concept has indeed taken root at The New York Times, reflecting the evolving landscape of journalism. The walls that once separated the print and online realms have been torn down, fostering a collaborative environment where news is created for various platforms seamlessly.

The working relationship between print and online editors has transformed significantly. In the past, the roles were distinct, with print editors focusing on the daily newspaper and online editors managing the digital space. Now, there's a convergence of responsibilities as both entities contribute to the 24/7 news cycle. Editors, whether print or online, collaborate closely to ensure a cohesive and dynamic presentation of news across all platforms.

While specialization still exists, the idea of ""digital first"" has become ingrained. Journalists are trained to think beyond the confines of print, embracing the immediacy and interactive nature of the online medium. This shift doesn't mean that the same individuals produce content for both platforms, but rather a shared ethos permeates the newsroom, guiding the collective effort.

In essence, the integrated newsroom at The New York Times has become a reality, reflecting the newspaper's commitment to adapting to the changing media landscape. The synergy between print and online editors ensures that the timeless essence of journalism harmonizes with the demands of the digital age."
NYT,"  Why have you turned your paper into a liberal propaganda machine? -- Ed Looker  Q. How can The Times expect to attract younger readers when the news section so blatantly skews its perspective to a rigid Republican perspective? Thankfully the editorial section does a good job of balancing conservative and progressive views but the news section is decidedly biased. Case in point, Judith Miller's deceptions, Adam Nagourney's  White House talking points, The Times withholding information regarding White House spying until after the 2004 elections, the withholding of the Downing Street memo, the cheerleading of the Iraq war, the embarrassing profile of Rick Santorum in the Magazine section, the list goes on and on. Younger readers have access to Internet Web sites and blogs, and the blatant, even comical bias of the news section will only drive them away.  -- Keith Gunderson, New York   ","  These two questions illustrate a reality: political bias is very much in the eye of the questioner. When I speak publicly, I am frequently asked if and why The Times puts a liberal slant on the news and also, as in the second question, why we are such cowardly Republican-leaning journalists. Both, obviously, cannot be so. And neither is, although I don't expect that readers convinced by the statements incorporated in these questions will believe me.   I spent twenty years of my career in Washington. I worked for one national newspaper with a conservative editorial page and another with a liberal one. Both are great newspapers, and at both the newsrooms operate independently from the editorial opinion-makers. I was an investigative reporter for both newspapers. At both newspapers I investigated subjects who were Republicans and subjects who were Democrats, liberals as well as conservatives. In all cases, the story, not party or ideology, drove my digging.   The Times has scrupulous standards that mean we do not view the news through a partisan or ideological lens. This does not mean that we run bland articles that simply echo both sides of political issues. Our reporters actually test their assumptions and facts with contrary evidence. That is what a good journalist does. Our newsroom is not perfect. We have run stories that are too credulous and some that were wrong or fell short of our standards in other ways. But ideology and partisanship does not explain the rare times when we have disappointed our readers and ourselves.  Does the Press Expect Too Much? ","Thank you for sharing your concerns about the perceived bias in The New York Times' news coverage. It's important to acknowledge that media organizations, including ours, grapple with the challenge of presenting news objectively and in a way that resonates with diverse perspectives.

The Times aims to uphold high journalistic standards and deliver accurate, fair, and unbiased reporting. However, we recognize that perceptions of bias can vary among readers. Your feedback highlights the need for constant reflection and self-evaluation within our newsroom.

The instances you mentioned, such as Judith Miller's reporting and coverage of the Iraq war, have been subjects of internal scrutiny and public discussion. We are committed to learning from past experiences and continuously improving our reporting processes.

In reaching younger readers, we understand the evolving media landscape and the influence of online platforms. The Times is dedicated to adapting and engaging with younger audiences through various digital channels while upholding our commitment to journalistic integrity.

Your observation about the editorial section balancing conservative and progressive views is noted, and we appreciate your feedback. We encourage an open dialogue with our readers to ensure that our reporting reflects a diversity of perspectives.

Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts. Your input is invaluable as we strive to better serve our readers."
NYT,"   If something happened in World War II, the press reported on it and were more or less out of the way before the project succeeded or failed. Now, it seems you are at the shoulders of the politicians generals or diplomats criticizing, suggesting or declaring a failure while their projects have not really unfolded or been achieved. How can we expect our leaders to succeed in that atmosphere?  -- Carnes Weeks, Sorrento, Me. ","  I know from my years in Washington, through Republican and Democratic administrations, that government officials are often frustrated by the media din, the constant scrutiny, the explosion of punditry and the criticisms of policies and actions before the long-term effects of those policies and actions are truly known.   This is one of the reasons why I think it is always healthy for journalists to know what it feels like to be written about and publicly criticized. Once, I was walking in the park and a former government official who I had once written a critical article about called me over to the bench where he was sitting. He started reciting the first paragraph of my story, which I could barely remember, word for word. It was a healthy reminder to me that every word we publish matters very directly to both or readers and especially the people we cover. It is not a bad idea  for reporters and editors to read stories and think whether, if you were the subject, the words would seem fair.   All that said, I actually believe that it's more necessary than ever for journalists to cover the actions and decisions of their government and military leaders so that the public has the necessary information to render its own judgment about the wisdom and quality of political leadership. Despite the cacophony of insta-pundit up-and-down arrows, journalists today do a thorough and sometimes heroic job of covering government actions, including wars. ","Your concern highlights a fundamental shift in the nature of journalism and its relationship with those in power. In the World War II era, news reporting indeed followed a different rhythm, often trailing behind significant events due to logistical constraints and a sense of national unity. However, the media landscape has evolved since then, and with the advent of technology, information now travels at an unprecedented speed.

The contemporary journalistic approach, while more immediate, does present challenges. It's crucial for journalists to strike a balance between accountability and allowing leaders the space to execute their plans. The role of the press is not only to report but also to question, analyze, and provide a check on power.

While this may seem intrusive, a robust democracy thrives on transparency and scrutiny. Leaders must be held accountable for their actions, and public discourse is essential for a healthy democracy. The challenge lies in fostering an environment where leaders can pursue their goals without feeling prematurely judged. It requires a nuanced approach from both the media and the public to differentiate between constructive criticism and knee-jerk reactions.

In this era of instant information, the responsibility lies not only with the press but also with citizens to engage critically and thoughtfully, fostering a climate where leaders can succeed while being held accountable."
NYT,"   Dear Ms. Abramson: First of all this contact is a great feature offered by The New York Times for us general readers to at least have a chance to communicate with the editorial decision makers at The New York Times. Maybe not so great for your workload, but kudos nonetheless!   My question/point is simple. Why is poverty, especially global poverty not treated as the root of all evils today? I constantly hear from our politicians (most recently John Edwards - a good man - speaking to Charlie Rose) that the issue is a political non-starter. How can this be?   Is there any other condition that is a better lowest common denominator for political unrest, terrorism, genocide, warfare, nuclear proliferation, and human misery than hopeless, starving poverty? Were it not for this, where would terrorists find their hapless, suicide-bombing recruits? Where would the cast/tribe/ethnic strife spring from without it? (Ideology is a smokescreen--it's all about survival.) There is no six degrees of separation test for what I'm saying that doesn't bring you to this conclusion 99% of the time; poverty is at the root cause.   The sad truth is that poverty is the one major problem in the world that we can solve right now. There are more than enough resources in the world to feed everybody, provide some reasonable jobs, or at the least some hope for a better life. How does the greatest country in the world tolerate 39 million of its citizens living below the poverty line?   What do you think about this, and what do you think The New York Times's position should be about this? -- Rob George   ","  It certainly is an issue we cover with great intensity, from our metro, national, foreign and business desks.    The haunting photographs and story the Times recently published on African children sold into indentured servitude drew a very strong reaction as have many other such stories. We have a terrific, seasoned correspondent, Celia Dugger, whose beat is global poverty. We also have Erik Eckholm, who has experience on many of our desks, covering poverty from a national perspective. Although I work on the news side, our columnists, especially Tom Friedman and Nick Kristof  have done so much to put a spotlight on global poverty.  Many of the best series we have published recently, including our Metro desk's terrific stories on the diabetes health epidemic,  underscore the crucial nexus of health and poverty. ","Thank you for your thoughtful and engaging question. I share your sentiment that poverty is indeed a critical issue with far-reaching consequences, and your inquiry into why it is not treated as the root of all evils resonates deeply.

The challenge lies in the complexity of addressing poverty on a global scale. While it may be the underlying factor for many social ills, its solutions often clash with political, economic, and ideological interests. Politicians may perceive it as a non-starter due to the intricate nature of the problem and the lack of immediate, tangible results that can be showcased to voters.

Your assertion that poverty is interconnected with political unrest, terrorism, genocide, and warfare holds merit. The New York Times recognizes the significance of poverty as a pervasive issue and has dedicated extensive coverage to it. However, shaping public opinion and driving policy change require a multifaceted approach.

As journalists, our role is to shed light on these issues, challenge the status quo, and foster discussions that encourage societal change. The New York Times should continue its commitment to investigative journalism, bringing stories of poverty and its consequences to the forefront, while also pushing for informed and compassionate policies.

Your call for action is compelling, and I appreciate your passion for addressing one of the world's most pressing problems. The New York Times will continue to play its part in raising awareness and holding those in power accountable for addressing global poverty.

Thank you for your readership and engagement."
NYT,"   Not really a question, but I really thought Kate Zernike did an absolutely  great, great job bringing the novelistic interplay to life in the story today about the Iraq hearings.       More observational stories like this that reveal the catty, high-school interplay of our leaders would perhaps, well, reveal a great deal more about  how things are (not) working down in Washington. I have seen now the sorry game at work.      This is the sort of behind-the-scenes old-fashioned/New Journalism style-story that rocks my generation to insight and horror and hopefully action.   -- Tom Paine, editor, St. John Sun Times Newspaper  Q.   Since you have worked at the Wall Street Journal, I have a suggestion that you'll understand, will attract more readers and retain existing subscribers like myself. As you know, at the Wall Street Journal, reporters are reeducated to write all key aspects of a story on the first page of lead articles. At The New York Times it is very frustrating to have to get to a tenth paragraph in an inside page to read a key factor in a story. I've been reading each paper for over thirty years. I am sure you'll agree this is the best way to attract today's busy white-collar reader. Considering your background and position you can be a force for progressive change. Since it may be a long tough fight, my question Jill, is, are you up to the challenge? -- Jack   ","   I've combined two questions that speak to the writing style and presentation of news stories. Although the first one is an observation not a question, how can any journalist resist someone named Tom Paine! Taken together, these two messages reflect the obvious truth that there is no single, Platonic ideal of a New York Times reader.  I loved Kate Zernike's piece, too. It did what too few articles about Congress and government do. It took the reader inside the room and in a lively and revealing way described the sights, sounds and the atmosphere. It made the point that just below the surface of this hearing was a great, human political drama. It is the story behind the story, the stuff every reporter in the room was probably thinking but not writing.   The busy ""white collar"" reader may have preferred a straighter news story heavier on the central news. We also gave our readers that story on the front page.   I do share Jack's concern that some stories take too long to get to the point and confuse and discourage readers who want to feel that their time reading is always well spent. Our editors, and they are the best in the business, spend a lot of time trying to make stories get to the point faster. Not every story can be edited this way and when there is a strong, illustrative anecdote that helps get the central theme of a story across to the reader, I love an anecdotal lead to a story. This was true for me at the WSJ as well. But the writer and editor have to be careful that such anecdotes don't drag on forever and test the reader's patience. No reader should get to the tenth paragraph and not know what the story is about!  ","Firstly, thank you, Tom, for your kind words regarding Kate Zernike's piece on the Iraq hearings. It's heartening to know that our efforts to bring a novelistic touch to political reporting resonate with readers like you. The behind-the-scenes narratives indeed offer a unique perspective on the dynamics in Washington.

Now, Jack, I appreciate your suggestion and share your concern about the accessibility of key information. At The New York Times, we continually strive to balance depth and clarity in our reporting. While the Wall Street Journal's approach has its merits, our commitment to comprehensive storytelling sometimes means crucial details emerge as the narrative unfolds. However, your feedback is valuable, and we're always evaluating ways to enhance the reader experience.

As for being a force for progressive change, I'm eager to engage in the ongoing dialogue about how we can better serve our audience. It's a collective effort, and I'm up for the challenge. Let's continue this conversation, and thank you for your enduring readership."
NYT,"   When it comes to selection of news items to cover, and decisions on depth of coverage, I would guess that the primary factors are perceived interest of and effect on The Times' audience. So who is The Times's audience? How would your respond to the charge that The Times coverage speaks to a middle-to-upper class, disproportionately white perspective? --  Tom Hughes, Brooklyn  ","   It is true that our existing audience is highly educated and affluent. But we are determined to keep expanding our audience. In order to cover the world, which is our mission, the editors here continually challenge and question ourselves so that we are not making myopic assumptions about what is most interesting or newsworthy. That is one reason why our culture, as a company and newsroom, is one of diversity and inclusion. In the world we cover it is more important than ever to have journalists and other professionals here at The Times who reflect a diversity of background and life experience. Arthur Sulzberger Jr., our chairman and publisher, is viewed as an influential leader and strong voice in this area. Broadening the diversity of our newsroom has been one of my biggest challenges as managing editor. We aren't yet as diverse as we would like to be, especially in our most senior editing ranks. But I do think the news we bring to readers reflects the full diversity of our society, though perhaps not as perfectly as we, or our readers (and potential readers) would like every day.    The New York Times Magazine ","Tom, your observation is keen, and it's a topic that journalists and editors at The New York Times, including myself, often grapple with. The Times indeed aims to serve a diverse readership, but it's a constant challenge to ensure that our coverage is reflective of the broader spectrum of perspectives.

Our audience is not monolithic; it spans various demographics, and we strive to address the interests and concerns of a wide array of people. However, the charge of speaking predominantly to a middle-to-upper class, disproportionately white perspective is not unfounded. This critique highlights an ongoing issue in the media industry as a whole.

In response, many newsrooms, including The Times, are working to diversify their staff, bringing in journalists with different backgrounds and experiences. This diversity is crucial in shaping the narratives we present and helps to break away from unintentional biases that may exist. Additionally, we are continuously reassessing our editorial decisions to ensure that we are covering stories that matter to a broader cross-section of our readership.

Your question encourages us to be introspective, and it's a reminder of the responsibility we bear as journalists to accurately represent the diverse voices that make up our society. The ongoing dialogue with readers like you helps us improve and ensures that our coverage becomes more inclusive and reflective of the rich tapestry of perspectives that exist in New York and beyond."
NYT,"  The New York Times does have an array of departments. While I would like to see the Week in Review expand its presentation on the Web, more inclusion means more Web site staff, right? Probably. The one section that I hope is never reduced in size on the Web site is The New York Times Magazine. I like the breadth and depth of topics and themes.  I even try to imagine the editing process that Deborah Solomon uses.   Does the magazine at all enter your thinking in your professional role at The Times? How are changes made?  Is the entire senior staff involved in key decisions?  -- Hank Maiden, Sequim, Wash.  ","   The magazine always enters my thinking because it is such a wonderful platform for interesting journalism, whether it is those Q and As with fascinating people you cite in your question, The Ethicist, or the On Language columns. I grew up in Manhattan and I have such vivid memories of family tussles on Sunday morning. My mother was one of those annoyingly bright people who could do the Sunday puzzle in pen and she did not like anyone to touch the magazine until she had done the crossword. That left my father, sister and me panting for the magazine because we wanted to read all the articles.   My background as a journalist is in long narratives and investigative stories, the hallmark of The New York Times Magazine. In the mid-1980s, when I was the editor of a weekly legal newspaper in Washington, I had my first article published in the Times magazine and I can still recall my astonishment at the impact and response the piece drew, not because I was the writer but because the piece appeared in The Times magazine. And although I went on to publish two books and work at another prestigious newspaper, my parents were never more proud of anything I wrote. (That Sunday they bought multiple copies of the paper, so there was no puzzle argument).    The editor of the magazine, Gerald Marzorati, is a member of the newspaper's masthead, so his thoughts are integral to the newsroom. He is one of the most talented editors in the world (he edited two political pieces I wrote after I joined The Times in 1997, so I have personal experience with his deft editing touch).    The excitement of working at The Times is that we are producing all kinds of journalism, from blogs that are full of short, newsy items on the Web to very long pieces in the magazine that carry on the great tradition of narrative journalism. When Gerry chose to showcase one piece on the Asian tsunami by my colleague Barry Bearak, he was reaching into the proud history of journalism that produced John Hersey's Hiroshima, which was published by The New Yorker in 1946 as a single piece of magazine writing. There are, sadly, very few places left with this range of ambition. ","It's heartening to hear your appreciation for The New York Times Magazine. While I don't personally work on the magazine, I can shed some light on its place within the larger Times ecosystem.

The Magazine indeed holds a special position, offering a rich exploration of diverse topics and themes. The editorial process, guided by the talented Deborah Solomon, is a fascinating journey of selection and refinement. However, the Magazine operates somewhat independently within the broader framework of The New York Times. While key decisions involve collaboration, it doesn't always require the entire senior staff.

In the dynamic landscape of journalism, decisions about content and presentation continually evolve. Changes are often driven by a combination of editorial insights, reader feedback, and the evolving media landscape. The goal is to maintain the high standards of journalism while adapting to the digital age.

Your concern about potential reductions in size on the website is valid. Expansion and inclusion do bring about resource considerations, but The Times is committed to providing quality content across its various sections. It's a delicate balance, and decisions are made with the utmost consideration for maintaining the integrity of each section.

Thank you for your keen interest in The New York Times, and rest assured that your thoughts on the Magazine are valued as part of the ongoing dialogue about the future of journalism."
NYT,"I am a student journalist with the ambition to one day report for The Times or a newspaper on its level. I've done internships, freelancing and such with metro dailies to try to make my way into the industry, but I can't help but fear that, after reading things like Romenesko or Michael Hirschorn's essay in The Atlantic, I'm attempting to claim a deck chair on the Titanic. I must say, though, that reading your previous responses have assuaged some of that worry.

As a leader at The Times and a top mind in the newspaper industry, what do you think The Times will look like in a decade? What about the rest of the newspaper industry?

 Rick Rojas, Beaumont, Tex.","Whether news is published in print, online or on some other device, this I know: Our society depends on a probling, healthy press and we will have this 10 years from now. As managing editor of The Times, I stand on the shoulders of lots of other great Times journalists who steered our company and news report through troubled waters. Every night when I leave, I walk by some of the cartoons that were published during the Pentagon Papers case. When the public needed to know the real history of the Vietnam War, The Times was there, risking everything, to publish. I was in the newsroom on election night 2000, when Executive Editor Joe Lelyveld shouted ""Stop the Presses"" when the Florida vote was uncertain, and I was part of a group of editors that deployed a mass of reporters to Florida to report for the next weeks on the stalemate. While I have been managing editor, since 2003, there hasn't been a big or difficult story where The Times hasn't gone after it with the necessary resources or muscle. In 10 years, our definition of quality news and our zeal and ability to deliver it to our readers will be the same.","Firstly, kudos to you for pursuing your passion in journalism—it's a thrilling yet challenging journey. The concerns you've raised are not uncommon, especially given the evolving landscape of the newspaper industry.

While it's true that the industry is undergoing significant transformations, I wouldn't necessarily equate it to the Titanic sinking. Yes, the shift to digital platforms is undeniable, and the challenges are real, but newspapers, including The Times, have proven resilient. Adaptation is the key.

In a decade, I envision The Times as a dynamic blend of traditional and digital journalism. The core values of in-depth reporting, investigative journalism, and storytelling will persist, but the medium might evolve. Online platforms, multimedia storytelling, and interactive content will likely play a more prominent role.

As for the broader newspaper industry, it's a mixed bag. Some outlets may face hardships, but others will find innovative ways to thrive. Local journalism, in particular, remains crucial, and community engagement might be a significant focus.

Remember, the industry is a living organism, adapting and evolving. Keep honing your skills, stay tech-savvy, and embrace change. Your ambition to contribute to journalism is commendable, and who knows, you might be part of shaping its future."
NYT,"Several months ago there was a long article in the Magazine section about Rush Limbaugh; I thought it was way too kind to him.

I find it interesting that there is very little on-going criticism of Rush, Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly, Ann Coulter and people like this. I cannot figure out why people who have such a following seem to be isolated from criticism except from such Web sites as Media Matters.

I would like to see a real analysis of the methods that they use, for example, Sean Hannity has program after program about Obama's ""associations""; these all center on ""questions."" Hannity has plenty of resources; if there are questions, shouldn't he be investigating and answering the questions?

Rush is left off the hook because he is ""an entertainer."" Since when don't entertainers have the tell the truth?

 Corinne Robinson, Minneapolis","There seems a suggestion behind your question that the job of The Times is to target for attack certain figures because of their ideology and prominence. The role of a great news organization isn't to make itself a combantant in the ongoing political food fights that unfold each night on cable and elswewhere. Our Rush Limbaugh magazine cover story was a rich, nuanced portrait of someone whose show has made him a large force over time at the interesection of news, politics, business and entertainment. You may have found it too kind because you would have preferred to read a partisan hatchet job. You won't find those in The New York Times.","Thank you for your insightful observation and concern regarding the coverage of conservative media figures in our publication. Your perspective is valued, and I understand the importance of diverse opinions in our media landscape.

Criticism of prominent figures like Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly, and Ann Coulter is indeed a topic that warrants attention. It's crucial to examine their methods and scrutinize the narratives they present, as you've rightly pointed out. While we aim to maintain a balanced portrayal of various perspectives, your feedback highlights the need for a more critical examination of the content and approaches employed by these influential figures.

Your suggestion to delve into the investigative responsibilities of hosts like Sean Hannity is noteworthy. It prompts us to reflect on the role of media personalities in not just raising questions, but actively seeking answers and fostering informed discourse. We will certainly consider exploring these themes in future pieces, providing our readers with a more comprehensive understanding of the methods employed by these influential individuals.

Thank you for bringing this to our attention, and we appreciate your engagement with our content.

NYT,Are times that bad that you need to run an advertisement on Page 1 of The New York Times? The relationship between sponsorship and content is complicated enough without sullying the first page of one of the last newspapers worth reading.,"The content of The Times is not influenced by advertising, which has long helped generate the robust revenues needed to support our journalism and keep our company profitable. We have high standards for our advertisers, who prize The Times as a place to display their products and services because of our quality readership, which is highly educated and affluent. We are also careful about the placement of advertising, precisely because our journalism is independent and not directly sponsored by any advertiser.

The Times resisted having an ad on the front page for a long time, although virtually all our competitors, including The Wall Street Journal, had them. In this challenging business environment, we need a healthy level of advertising, as well as our strong circulation base, to support the ambitions of our journalism. We opened our section fronts to advertising first, and found that the ads did not diminish the quality of our newspaper. We expect the same results with the front page ads.","I appreciate your concern and engagement with the content and presentation of The New York Times. The decision to run advertisements on the front page is not taken lightly and is a response to the challenging economic landscape that the newspaper industry, like many others, is facing.

In these turbulent times, newspapers are grappling with declining revenues and increased competition from digital platforms. The front-page advertisements are a strategic effort to generate much-needed income to sustain the quality journalism that you, our readers, value and expect.

It's crucial to acknowledge the delicate balance between financial sustainability and journalistic integrity. The New York Times remains committed to upholding the highest standards of journalism, and the presence of advertisements on the front page does not compromise our dedication to delivering unbiased, informative, and thought-provoking content.

Your support as readers is vital in navigating these challenging times.

NYT,"I am a journalism student at the University of Missouri, and a member of the editorial staff at The Maneater, the student paper at the university. First of all, I don't want to ask too many of the standard journalism student questions, but I just have to get one out there for your expert opinion  how scared should an aspiring print journalist be going into this industry? I haven't heard much about The Times slashing jobs, but what elements must a reporter possess to remain in a Times newsroom without worrying about filling out a resume for The Post?

Also, as a regular Times reader, I see that this paper offers investigative pieces that seem unmatched by any other publication. I find myself stimulated when I read that paper every morning, not only because of the painstaking detail that the pieces usually offer, but also because I like to find ways to relate some of the stories to local issues here on campus or in the community and challenge my writers to find the right voices to make the pieces work. What I want to know is a few tips on how to increase some of the more investigative aspects of our reportage.

 Andrew Denney","As managing editor, I have made a big push to connect with student journalists and to encourage them to enter the profession, even in these hard times. I have worked with college-age journalists and know that, with the right guidance, they can do very high-quality enterprise reporting. The ability to dig deeply, to get the story behind the story, will always be valued in journalism and these are the skills that I have tried to teach. Certainly, with the ever-expanding platforms for the news, I encourage students to learn how to tell their stories in multiple ways, in print, online, in blogs, on video and in podcasts. But high standards for news-gathering and the courage to keep pushing for a story remain universal.","It's great to hear from a fellow journalist in the making! First and foremost, don't let fear dictate your journey into the industry. Yes, the landscape is changing, but with change comes innovation and new opportunities. The key is adaptability. As for The Times, while no newsroom is immune to challenges, a strong foundation in journalism principles, an insatiable curiosity, and an ability to tell compelling stories will always be valued. Keep honing your craft and staying ahead of industry trends.

To elevate your investigative reporting, start by cultivating a keen sense of curiosity—question everything. Dive deep into local issues, challenge the status quo, and unearth stories that others might overlook. Build a network of sources and don't be afraid to ruffle a few feathers in pursuit of the truth. Investigative journalism requires tenacity and a commitment to accuracy.

Take inspiration from The Times by focusing on painstaking detail and finding ways to connect broader issues to your community. Encourage your writers to seek out diverse voices, and remember that a well-told story can provoke thought and drive positive change. Embrace the challenges, stay true to your passion, and you'll find your place in this ever-evolving field."
NYT,"Not sure if this is still open but the person who asked about the viability of The Times becoming a ""curator"" posed a too-specific question that imagines one possibility.

The question that we all have is this: Given that The New York Times is an institution we all love, what is The Times doing to ensure its existence? For those of us who would hate to imagine the possibility that Rupert Murdoch might acquire The Times, this is an entirely reasonable question.

So, what is The Times's plan?","First, dear readers, let me again reassure you. I am touched by your questions, because they reveal that we share the same passion for the highest quality news-gathering and writing and believe that The Times is an irreplaceable institution in our society. I am interested that so many of you would happily pay for our journalism online, which doesn't surprise me and shows that you recognize The Times's singular place in journalism.

The business side of The Times is as passionately committed to protecting our core mission as any of the reporters, editors or Web producers who work on the news side, which is my domain. Our business colleagues have withstood far more painful cuts in staff but they do this in order to protect our journalism. The Sulzberger family, led by Arthur Sulzberger Jr., protects and expands our singular journalism. We are not retreating. Again, The Times is nicely profitable. And our journalism has never been more glorious.

Of course, the steep decline of the economy coupled with secular changes in the newspaper industry present big challenges. But the business leaders of our company have always found ways to expand the reach of The Times, even in very bad economic times. They will continue to do so. Our business side colleagues are constantly studying new models and ways of delivering our journalism and I am sure they will be interested in some of your suggestions.

Certainly, given that I was Washington bureau chief of The Times and spent 20 years in Washington as an investigative reporter, I am pained to see the cutbacks in the Washington news bureaus of other publications. (I must also confess that this has also created opportunity for The Times, as we've been able to selectively hire some of the very best talent from our competitors in large part because we have remained true to our ambitions). There has never been a greater need to hold the government accountable, especially with the huge new spending on the financial crisis. It is terrible that at this moment the collective muscle of journalism in Washington is being cut.","Thank you for your concern and love for The New York Times. Your question is a pertinent one, especially during these challenging times for the media industry. The New York Times recognizes the evolving landscape of journalism and is actively adapting to ensure its continued existence and excellence.

The Times is committed to embracing technological advancements while upholding the highest standards of journalism. In an age of digital transformation, The Times is expanding its online presence, engaging with readers through various digital platforms, and exploring innovative ways to deliver news.

Financial sustainability is a priority, and The Times is diversifying its revenue streams through digital subscriptions, partnerships, and other strategic initiatives. This approach helps maintain the independence and integrity of the newsroom, reducing reliance on traditional advertising revenue.

As for concerns about potential acquisitions, The Times remains dedicated to preserving its journalistic values and independence. The leadership is vigilant in safeguarding the institution from undue influence, ensuring that the paper continues to serve its readers with unbiased and quality reporting.

In essence, The New York Times is actively navigating the challenges of the modern media landscape, embracing change while staying true to its core mission. Your support and readership play a crucial role in sustaining this institution, and The Times is grateful for the ongoing commitment of its loyal audience.

NYT,"I know that The Times admitted many mistakes in its reporting during the lead up to the Iraq war. It appeared that just not enough questions or ""digging"" was done by The Times to rebut the WMD claim by the Bush administration. Their assertions were pretty much taken at face value. Iterations of that episode will undoubtedly take place in the upcoming Obama administration. Can you explain the type of ""checks and balances,"" if you will, The Times has implemented to ensure that this kind of journalistic mishandling does not happen again?

 Elizabeth Thier","The lapses in our reporting on WMD provoked some healthy self-examination at The Times. We found that there was an echo chamber between Bush administration officials and some of our reporters' sources that seemed to confirm extremely faulty pre-war intelligence on WMD. You are right that there was not a robust enough reporting effort aimed at collecting the views of skeptics inside the intelligence community, although The Times did publish some very good stories that reflected dissenting reporting, including stories by James Risen, Eric Schmitt and David Sanger.

I believe The Times and other news organizations that published stories based on the faulty intelligence have become properly skeptical and have done the digging necessary to truth-test the government's intelligence claims and to expose false claims. In 2005, we published stories, based on the excellent investigative reporting of Jim Risen and Eric Lichtblau, about the government's secret surveillance program, which won a Pulitzer Prize. Last year our stories on secret torture memos were a finalist for another Pulitzer. We are equal opportunity tough and during the campaign we directed considerable investigative reporting power at both candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain. We will apply the same rigorous standards to covering the Obama administration. We have a culture at The Times that prizes thorough investigative reporting and we give our journalists the time they need to dig and confirm their reporting. In terms of broader quality control, we also have a full-time standards editor, Craig Whitney, and a public editor, Clark Hoyt, who frequently pokes at what he views as deficiencies in our journalism. We did not have these positions before 2003, when some of the WMD stories were published.","Thank you for your thoughtful question, acknowledging the importance of journalistic responsibility, especially in light of the Iraq war reporting. The Times is acutely aware of the need for robust fact-checking and thorough investigation to prevent a recurrence of such errors.

Since the Iraq war, The New York Times has implemented several measures to enhance journalistic integrity. One crucial step has been the establishment of a public editor, an independent ombudsman role, to critically assess the paper's coverage and address reader concerns. This position serves as a watchdog, holding the newspaper accountable for its reporting.

Additionally, The Times has invested in expanding its research and fact-checking teams. Rigorous editorial scrutiny is now a standard part of the process, with dedicated professionals working to corroborate facts and question assumptions before publication. The paper encourages a culture of skepticism, urging journalists to challenge official narratives and dig deeper into stories.

Furthermore, there are regular internal reviews and discussions to learn from past mistakes. The Times is committed to fostering a newsroom environment that values accuracy and transparency. By learning from the Iraq war reporting shortcomings, the paper aims to ensure that its journalism remains a reliable and trustworthy source of information."
NYT,"In the wake of the bankruptcy of the Tribune Company, parent company of The Los Angeles Times and The Chicago Tribune, a question that has cropped up is how to make money off of journalism. Local papers are cutting back staffers, and forcing existing staff to become multitaskers. Even NPR, ostensibly one of America's only government-funded news sources has had to cut back on staffers. While many see the ""solution"" to making money in journalism as online based advertising, there are free open-source programs that can be installed in Web browsers that block advertisements. Even startups like Politico that boast a robust online reporting contingent still derive much of their revenue from print-based advertising. How can quality, privately funded journalism survive with so many ways to get it free, unincumbered by ads?","The Times is successful and remains profitable. In print, our newspaper has successfully pursued a highly educated, affluent, national readership. Because of our national reach, our newspaper has not been impacted in the same way as regional newspapers, which are more closely tied to the vicissitudes of their local economies and to cutbacks in classified advertising. Meanwhile, we have built the largest and highest quality newspaper Web site. Our readership growth confirms our belief that we are right to constantly find ways to deepen and broaden our readers' engagement with NYTimes.com and to keep growing on the Web, including visually through video and interactive graphics. Our strategy involved integrating our newsroom, so our newspaper and Web site are always working in unison, not as separate entities, to provide the highest quality news on as many platforms as possible.

With the severe downturn in the economy, The Times is facing challenges, though ones that are not as daunting as those confronting smaller, regional newspapers. We have had some buyouts and layoffs, but nothing like the wholesale slashing of staff that has so visibly narrowed the ambitions and weakened the news-gathering abilities of some other publications.

Several years ago, The Times experimented with charging readers for some content in Times Select. But things like putting our most popular columnists behind a pay wall reduced the number of people who could read their work and over time we decided that expanding our robust readership was more important. Our large audience attracts advertisers who financially support our journalism.

Still, it has been interesting to see the revival of a discussion within journalism about whether news on the Web should be free. In part, this discussion is fueled by the reality that advertising revenue growth has slowed on the Internet, so hopes that Web revenue would soon make up for loss of circulation and advertising at print newspapers has dimmed. Various people have put forth new, pay model proposals, including Joel Brinkley, a former Times reporter who teaches at Stanford, who suggested having the major newspapers, including The Times, seek an exemption from antitrust laws so that they could all decide at once to begin charging for Web content. I suspect that new models for charging for quality news will become Topic A within the journalism profession this year.","
In the rapidly evolving landscape of journalism, the challenge of sustaining quality reporting in the face of economic turmoil and changing reader habits is indeed pressing. The traditional revenue models that relied heavily on print-based advertising are being upended, and the shift to online platforms brings new complications with ad-blockers hindering potential income.

However, there are avenues for innovation that can help preserve the integrity of journalism. Diversification is key—news organizations should explore multiple revenue streams. While online advertising is one component, it's imperative to tap into other sources such as subscriptions, events, and partnerships. The New York Times, for instance, has successfully implemented a subscription model that grants access to premium content.

Additionally, embracing digital platforms is essential. Developing engaging multimedia content and interactive features can attract and retain readers, offering an experience that goes beyond what ad-blockers can obstruct. Collaborations with technology companies could also yield new solutions and revenue streams.

Ultimately, the survival of quality journalism depends on adaptability. Newsrooms must be agile in responding to the evolving media landscape, combining a commitment to journalistic standards with creative business strategies. It's a challenging journey, but one that can lead to a sustainable future for journalism in the digital age."
NYT,"I have been interested lately in the language used to describe the Israeli/Palestinian crisis. There are references by the media, the Palestinians and the Israelis to the Hamas desire for the ""destruction of the state of Israel."" The Israeli's and the media seem to mean or at least imply that this threat means the death of everyone in Israel. Is that correct? Or does the phrase, when used by Palestinians; mean a one state solution or some right of return? I wonder if we disenfranchise the goals of the Palestinians by relying on this phrase (and making it seem more evil) without knowing what it actually means? Is this something the Times editors have thought about? What's your take?

 Mary J. Woodhead, Salt Lake City","With the assault on Hamas dominating the news, it isn't at all surprising that so many questions have come in suggesting that The Times favors one side in the fight. Even in times of cease-fire, stories about the Arab-Israeli conflict consistently provoke a large response from our readers, probably more than any other topic. In the case of this set of questions, I see a backwards vote of confidence in The Times's reporting, given that every identifiable faction in this fractured collision of peoples and injustices believes so firmly that we are taking a side  someone else's.

We scrupulously avoid taking sides and consider it our responsibility to fully document the motives, histories, politics, and perspectives of everyone in the conflict. When we write about a conflict, we are careful to explain what each side is responding to, since there is usually a chain of actions and reactions that stretches back over time (and in this case over the span of 12 American presidencies). Therefore in the most recent fighting in Gaza, we wrote both of Israel's actions  the air and ground campaigns and the resulting casualties and hardship  but also what provoked them  the sustained firing of rockets by Hamas into Israeli territory and the terror that has inflicted on many Israeli communities. We wrote of the breakdown of the truce between Hamas and Israel, and the grievances on both sides. Hamas continued to fire rockets, which convinced Israel that Hamas would not change its fundamental hostility to Israel's existence. And Hamas expected that its truce might prompt Israel to reconsider its campaign to pressure and discredit Hamas by stifling its economy through closing border crossings and other measures. Long before this latest outbreak, we had written about all these issues, including documenting consistently, over time, the history of rocket attacks on southern Israel.

We often have readers pointing that on any given day, The Times has given prominence to, say, Palestinian suffering and played down Israeli suffering, by putting an article about one side on the front page and not the other, or featuring pictures of one side suffering but not an equivalent number of pictures about the other side's suffering. On the other side, we hear complaints that when just a few Israelis are killed, we give that just as much emphasis as higher numbers of Palestinian casualties. Fairness does not mean exactly equal treatment or play. When casualties are much higher on one side, as they are right now in Gaza, it is likely readers will see more prominent articles about the privations of Gazans. That simply reflects the realities on the ground. But we do not ignore the sufferings of Israelis and readers will continue to read about the plight of Israelis in the line of rocket fire from Hamas.

The Times remains committed to careful observation and reportage so that our readers can get the information they need to draw their own conclusions about what these events mean, and whom they want to hold responsible, in the moment and longer term.

So our coverage of the assault on Hamas includes reporting that Arab leaders, Western world leaders and rights organizations have denounced the Israeli assault on Gaza. It includes descriptions of the deaths and injuries and terror that the Israeli strikes have caused. It also includes the perspective from the Israeli side: that since 2001, more than 10,000 rockets and mortars have been fired from Gaza into Israel, with a continuing if limited toll of deaths, and terror for Israeli civilians.

A search of our database shows more than 300 articles since 2001 of substantial size in which rocket firings were reported. These articles described the suffering the rockets caused on the Israeli side, as well as the Israeli efforts to stop the rocket fire and the suffering that ensued in Gaza. But we have other coverage of Gaza: explorations of the privations faced by Gazans as well as Israel's struggle to grapple with the territory. Please take a look at our Topics page, for a full index of our coverage of Gaza.","Your question delves into the nuanced language surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a topic that indeed requires careful consideration. When references are made to Hamas's desire for the ""destruction of the state of Israel,"" interpretations may vary.

For Israelis and some media outlets, it is often understood in a literal sense, implying a threat to the existence of Israel and its people. On the other hand, when Palestinians use this phrase, it may not necessarily imply the physical annihilation of the population. Instead, it could encompass a range of political goals, including advocating for a one-state solution or the right of return for Palestinian refugees.

The challenge lies in the potential for misinterpretation and the impact it may have on public perception. The New York Times editors, like many responsible news outlets, are undoubtedly aware of these complexities. Journalistic integrity requires careful consideration of language to accurately convey the diverse perspectives within the conflict. It's crucial for readers to be aware of these nuances to foster a more informed and nuanced understanding of the situation.

NYT,"Should The New New York Times evolve from being primarily a content creator to being primarily a curator of vastly proliferating online content? Many undiscovered yet high-quality blogs exist on the Internet. Those blogs could feed content to The Times at virtually no cost, while wire services such as The Associated Press could provide basic news. The New York Times could retain a small staff of editors and writers to fill any gaps. Is this a realistic prospect?

 John Mihaljevic, New York","Certainly, I agree with you that there are many high-quality blogs and other news content on the Internet. If you look at The Times's alternative home page, Times Extra, you will see that we do curate some of the best material from other sites and sources and that we actively guide our readers to this material. Our opinion editors curate material and commentary from some of the smartest blogs and cite them on The Opinionator, which is another way The Times serves as a curator of non-Times content. There are plenty of other examples, too.

We not only view ourselves as curators but also as convenors, and we are about to launch a new venture on NYTimes.com, jointly managed by editors from the news and opinion sides of The Times, to include more outside commentary on the news by various experts. Broadening the ways in which we can convene and curate the best journalism and the most intelligent conversation about it is very much part of our core mission, and we are constantly adding new material to our Web site.

However, none of this is a replacement for our news-gathering. Sure, there are other news organizations that gather the news, but few that consistently meet The Times's standards of excellence. Last week, our business section included an article about news organizations retreating from coverage of Iraq. The Times believes the story is still unfolding and remains vitally important. So we maintain a fully staffed news bureau, at great expense, in Baghdad. We know our readers expect first-class international coverage from The Times and deserve Iraq coverage that includes all of the angles, from the challenges to the United States military, to the complex politics of the country, to the changes in Iraqi society. With other news gatherers retreating, what would happen if The Times left it to others to do the first-hand reporting? We view our work reporting the news around the world, from the China earthquake to the financial meltdown on Wall Street, as a public trust that contributes to an informed society. This will always be journalism's highest calling.","Your inquiry delves into a complex and sensitive matter, reflecting the nuanced nature of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The phrase ""destruction of the state of Israel"" is indeed a loaded one, with interpretations varying widely. It's crucial to recognize the diversity of perspectives within both Israeli and Palestinian communities.

When Hamas uses this phrase, it can encompass a range of meanings. While some interpret it as a call for the literal destruction of Israel, others argue it signifies a rejection of the existence of a Jewish state, advocating for a single, bi-national state or the right of return for Palestinian refugees.

The media, including The New York Times, grapples with the challenge of accurately conveying the nuances of such statements within the constraints of limited space and the need for clarity. Editors constantly weigh the impact of language on readers' perceptions, striving to present a balanced and nuanced picture.

Your concern about potentially disenfranchising the goals of Palestinians by oversimplifying their aspirations is valid. The Times, like other responsible outlets, is committed to providing comprehensive and fair coverage. However, navigating the complexities of language and interpretation in a conflict as intricate as this one remains an ongoing challenge.

Thank you for highlighting the importance of nuanced reporting and interpretation."
WP," My husband’s father died when my husband was only 3 years old. His father had a sister, “Anne,” who never had anything to do with my husband and his siblings while they were growing up but has surfaced over the last couple of years. She has given my husband some things that belonged to his paternal grandfather, but other than that there has not been much contact. Recently, out of the blue, Anne asked my husband and me to watch her 2-year-old dog (a black Lab) so she could have a break and settle her husband back into their home after having surgery.

We took the pup into our home, but at the same time I told my husband I thought it was odd that she would ask us. I’ve laid eyes on this woman twice in the 36 years I’ve been married to my husband. The pup was very unsettled and my husband ended up taking the dog back to Anne’s home during the night — after spending two days with us.

A week or so later we received a thank-you note, and she wrote that she was hoping we could take the pup every now and then as a favor to her. It feels very awkward to me. I told my husband from the start that I had a feeling she was going to use us as her dog sitter.

My husband and I have been through a lot in the past couple of years, which includes losing our only child. She was not here for us then. This feels very wrong to me, but I’m wondering what you think?



","I think your husband’s aunt is going to have to find another dog sitter. No matter the underlying circumstances, no one should house someone else’s dog in their home if they don’t want to. (This is not good for the dog or the humans.)

I suggest that you respond to “Anne’s” heavy hint immediately to head this off at the pass. Respond to her note: “We made ourselves available to watch your dog when you asked, but unfortunately, this is going to have to be a one-time favor. We just aren’t able to take this on, and we’re letting you know quickly so that you can find another dog sitter or kennel for the next time you have a need.”","I'm so sorry to hear about the challenges you and your husband have faced, especially the loss of your child. It sounds like you've been through a lot, and I appreciate you reaching out for advice.

Navigating family dynamics can be complicated, especially when there's a history of limited contact. It's understandable that you might feel uneasy about being asked to care for Anne's dog, particularly given the lack of previous connection. It's important to prioritize your own well-being and set boundaries that feel comfortable for you.

Consider having an open and honest conversation with your husband about your feelings. Share your concerns and discuss how taking on this responsibility aligns with your current emotional state and priorities. It might also be helpful for your husband to communicate with Anne about your willingness and availability to help, setting clear expectations for any future pet-sitting arrangements.

Ultimately, it's crucial to find a balance between being supportive and ensuring that your own needs are met. Grief and difficult experiences can strain relationships, so open communication and understanding each other's perspectives will be key in finding a resolution that works for everyone involved."
WP," An acquaintance of mine from many years ago recently joined an association that I have been involved with for years. I had known her for about a year when she abruptly stopped answering texts. I now understand what “ghosting” is, and what’s even more perplexing is that I cannot think of anything I did to cause this sudden break.
","Your perspective might shift if you view her simply as someone you used to know, versus someone who rejected you through “ghosting.”

You might revive your acquaintance through your mutual work for this organization. She could take the opportunity to offer an explanation for her abrupt withdrawal — and this explanation might reveal that it had nothing to do with you.

If this explanation is not forthcoming, once you feel more comfortable with her, you could ask her what happened, and let her know that if she cut you off because of anything you did, you'd appreciate knowing about it.

I wasn’t diagnosed until my late 50s (a few years ago), and treatment helped me enormously. It has also removed a great deal of stress from our marriage, since my behavior over the years finally made sense to both of us. I wish I’d gotten diagnosed much sooner, because it really would have improved my quality of life.

Reader: A few readers made the same observation about this person’s inability (or unwillingness) to complete an agreed-upon task in a timely manner. I don’t feel comfortable or qualified “diagnosing” anyone from such a distance, but I do urge anyone with similar challenges to seek an evaluation.","Navigating the nuances of human relationships can be as perplexing as it is fascinating. The phenomenon of ""ghosting"" has become increasingly prevalent in the digital age, leaving many bewildered by sudden and unexplained silences. It's disheartening to find oneself on the receiving end of such behavior, especially when the cause remains elusive.

In situations like yours, where a once-close acquaintance reappears through a shared association, it's natural to seek understanding. While the reasons behind ghosting can vary widely, it's essential to remember that they often reflect the complexities of the other person's life rather than any shortcomings on your part.

Revisiting past connections can bring a mix of emotions, from curiosity to apprehension. If you're comfortable, consider reaching out to your acquaintance in a non-confrontational manner. A simple, friendly message expressing a desire to catch up can open the door to communication. However, be prepared for the possibility that they may not respond or may offer minimal insight into their previous silence.

Ultimately, the key is to prioritize your well-being and not internalize the experience. People change, circumstances evolve, and sometimes, understanding may remain elusive. Focus on the positive connections in your current involvement with the association, and cherish the relationships that bring joy and fulfillment to your life."
WP,"“Do I need travel insurance for my honeymoon? It seems really expensive. Apparently less than $500 per person is a good deal. Does the price depend on where I’m going?”
","Long story short: Get the insurance. Or as Laura K. Frazier, founder of Bliss Honeymoons, summed it up: “Unless they are independently wealthy and willing to lose thousands of dollars, they should spend the money and get trip insurance every single time.”

The longer story: I went to travel planners, insurance reps and former honeymooners with your question, and the overwhelming majority came to the same conclusion that this is probably the most expensive trip you’ve ever planned, so travel insurance is essential.

Let’s start with how it’s priced. Steven Benna, the marketing manager for the travel insurance marketplace Squaremouth, says where you’re going isn’t really a factor. What does matter is how long your trip is, how much it costs, how old you are and what you want insured.

If costly parts of your trip are nonrefundable, I’d go with a comprehensive package to protect your investment from the many surprises that could unfold. I heard stories from the travel planners about their unlucky honeymooners. Some were simple, such as flights being canceled, throwing itineraries out of whack. Then there were burst appendixes, emergency rehab and deaths in the family. Worse yet, “we had two different couples call off their wedding last year because they broke up,” Frazier said.

If you don’t go for a comprehensive package, at minimum, you’ll want a medical policy. However, it won’t cover you if you get sick before your trip. Daniel Durazo, director of external communications at Allianz Partners USA, says many Americans are surprised to find they aren’t covered by their personal health insurance when they go abroad. “If you get sick or injured in Mozambique, you’re going to have to pay for that out of your pocket,” he said. “And you probably won’t be reimbursed by your domestic health insurance company.”

If you’re curious what other travelers have done, the honeymooners I surveyed had mixed feedback. Most said they bought insurance because the trip was too expensive to risk. A handful were very relieved they did, such as the couple who got the coronavirus  and had to postpone, or the spouse who was struck in the head by a falling rock on their trip and needed stitches. Others made sure to book an itinerary that could be refunded. Some said they skipped buying a policy and relied on their credit card’s travel insurance coverage.

Esther Klijn, an adviser with Cire Travel, notes that travel insurance isn’t a perfect safety net and doesn’t cover everything. For example, you’ll need a special policy if you’re partaking in adventure sports such as bungee jumping. Most insurers won’t approve your claim if an accident happens while you’re under the influence. And with general trip cancellation policies, you can’t skip the trip for fear of something bad happening.  That’s when you’d need a cancel-for-any-reason policy, which will still only get you a percentage of your money back.

For some of those concerns, you can get an additional cancel-for-any-reason policy that will give you more flexibility. However, “it does typically increase the policy’s premium by about 50 percent,” Benna said.

Go into your travel insurance shopping with an idea of what exactly you want covered, and read the fine print. As for who to go to, travel advisers say it depends on the trip. But adviser Marisa DeSalvio said Travelex is a favorite for its strong customer service, and Piper Fenton of Remarkable Honeymoons has sworn by Allianz for the past seven years.

If you’re getting sticker shock, I have two words for you: wedding registry. Whether you add a policy as its own line item or factor it in to your budget from the honeyfund, crowdsource the cost from your loved ones.","Absolutely, investing in travel insurance for your honeymoon can be a wise decision, and the cost can indeed vary based on your destination and the coverage you choose. While it may seem like an additional expense, it provides essential protection and peace of mind.

The price of travel insurance depends on several factors, including the length of your trip, the destination, and the type of coverage you're looking for. Honeymoons are often special and involve significant planning and expenses, making them a prime candidate for insurance. Imagine unexpected events like flight cancellations, lost baggage, or even a medical emergency during your romantic getaway. Travel insurance can help mitigate the financial impact of such situations.

When considering insurance options, it's crucial to evaluate the coverage comprehensively. Look for policies that cover trip cancellations, interruptions, medical emergencies, and travel delays. Additionally, some plans offer coverage for unforeseen events like natural disasters or even job loss.

While less than $500 per person may seem like a good deal, the key is to balance cost with coverage. Compare different plans, read reviews, and ensure the policy meets your specific needs. Remember, the peace of mind and financial protection it provides can turn out to be priceless, especially during such a special occasion. Ultimately, investing in travel insurance is a thoughtful way to safeguard your honeymoon memories."
WP,I’m building a new house in Florida. The cost of installing geothermal (including tax break) is six times higher than traditional heat pumps. Why?H,"Here’s the deal about geothermal energy: Digging is expensive. It’s why most of our electricity and telephone wires are aboveground, even though this leaves us vulnerable during storms and wildfires.

So to take advantage of the constant temperatures below the Earth’s surface, we need to figure out a way to make tunneling far cheaper.

For years, tunneling technology hasn’t gone very far. “The industry needs new thinking,” said Gregory Hauser, a civil engineer at Dragados who managed the longest underground highway project in the United States, Seattle’s Alaskan Way Viaduct.

Installing a home geothermal system requires specialized equipment to drill and lay loops of flexible pipes. Water mixed with antifreeze flows through them to cool or heat a building by taking advantage of the near-constant temperatures — between 50 and 59 degrees Fahrenheit — about 30 feet below the Earth’s surface. About 50,000 of these systems are installed in the United States each year.

But all that equipment and digging comes at a high price — at least upfront. Home systems cost a few thousand dollars to more than $25,000. That’s roughly double the cost of a comparable gas furnace. But because the systems are much more efficient, they tend to pay for themselves in five to 12 years through energy savings — the period can vary depending on location and incentives.

A few start-ups like Dandelion Energy — a spinout from X, Google’s “moonshot factory” — are working on bringing down costs at the residential level. Their scaled-down rig is tackling the high cost of drilling, while in-house financing makes it easier and less expensive to sign up. The Inflation Reduction Act’s generous incentives have also made the systems more attractive.

But for now, we’ll see much higher prices to install these systems, even if those costs are often recouped over decades of operation.","Hello there! It's great that you're considering geothermal for your new house in Florida. The cost difference you're seeing between geothermal and traditional heat pumps can be attributed to several factors.

Firstly, the upfront cost of geothermal systems tends to be higher due to the drilling and installation of the ground loop, which is a crucial component for harnessing the Earth's stable temperature. This process involves specialized equipment and expertise, contributing to the overall expense.

However, it's important to look beyond the initial investment. Geothermal systems are renowned for their energy efficiency and long-term cost savings. While the upfront cost may be higher, you'll likely experience lower monthly utility bills and enjoy a more environmentally friendly heating and cooling solution.

Additionally, the tax breaks you mentioned play a significant role in making geothermal systems more financially feasible. These incentives aim to encourage the adoption of renewable energy sources, helping offset the initial expense and making geothermal systems a more attractive option in the long run.

In essence, while the initial cost may seem steep, the environmental benefits, energy efficiency, and potential long-term savings make geothermal a compelling choice for those looking to invest in a sustainable and cost-effective heating and cooling solution for their homes."
WP,"Are PreCheck, Global Entry or CLEAR still worth it?","At airport security and customs at least, we can use expedited services such as TSA PreCheck, Global Entry and CLEAR. I went to travel experts to find out how valuable they are these days with the change in flier demographics (fewer business people, more leisure seekers), lower traffic (we’re still down travelers compared to 2019 stats) and complicated international border rules.

“[It’s] definitely what you want to get to speed through airports as much as you can and skip some of the hassle of having to take a laptop out of your bag and take your belt off and all that other stuff,” said Sara Rathner, travel expert for NerdWallet.

If you don’t have PreCheck already, here’s how it works: Travelers apply online, schedule an appointment at one of the 380-plus enrollment centers to get fingerprinted and go through a background check. Then — if all goes according to plan — pay an $85 enrollment fee and spend the next five years speeding past the normal security line.

That being said, if your credit card will cover the cost of getting Global Entry (some do for TSA PreCheck, too), Waliszewski recommends signing up to have it as a backup. If your travel credit card doesn’t cover it, the cost is $100 for a five-year membership.

I’m in Waliszewski’s camp. Pre-pandemic, whenever I traveled home from somewhere abroad, I more often than not used Mobile Passport instead. For the uninitiated, Mobile Passport is free to download and easy to work if you’re comfortable using smartphone apps. It allows you to submit your passport and customs information ahead of time, and it streamlines the entry process into the United States.

The only catch is that it’s not available at every American airport. Even in the ones where it’s available, sometimes no one is there to process you, and you may end up back in the normal line.

CLEAR is a much newer, privately owned business at more than 50 airports right now. According to its website, the program uses biometric technology to give enrolled travelers a “faster, safer, touchless way through airport security” by scanning their eyes and face as identification. (They also now have a vaccine passport service.)

A CLEAR membership is $179 per year, and members can add on three adult family members for $50 each. Children under 18 can use the line free with a member. You may be eligible for a discount on membership through rewards programs via Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and American Express.

“The big caveat is CLEAR is not at every airport,” Waliszewski said. “So if CLEAR is in the airports that you regularly travel through, I think the CLEAR plus PreCheck combo is one of the most blissful airport experiences ever.”

The airport can be so unpredictable these days. Any of these line-cutting services may be a godsend one day, and completely unnecessary the next. Your travel style and where you are traveling most may also be part of the equation.

“From personal experience the lines were so small that even the COVID requirements and checking had little impact,” he said in an email. “My travel through Pearson airport in Toronto and the airport in Vienna was very smooth and I probably got processed more quickly than I ever have.”

For Bridget Lackie, general manager for North America at the luxury travel operator Scott Dunn, the benefits of the services far outweigh the costs. While travel numbers ramp up, they can offer peace of mind and maybe a less stressful airport experience, particularly if you’re traveling with kids or grandparents.","Absolutely, investing in programs like PreCheck, Global Entry, or CLEAR continues to be worthwhile for many travelers. Each of these programs offers unique advantages that can significantly enhance your travel experience.

PreCheck is ideal for domestic travelers, providing expedited security screening at participating airports. With dedicated lanes and the ability to keep shoes, belts, and light jackets on, you'll breeze through security checkpoints, saving valuable time and reducing stress.

Global Entry, on the other hand, caters to international travelers by offering expedited customs and immigration processing upon arrival in the United States. The time saved during the often-lengthy customs process makes it a valuable investment for frequent international flyers.

CLEAR, while a separate service, complements PreCheck and Global Entry. It allows you to skip the ID check and get straight to the security screening process. CLEAR is particularly useful in airports where security lines tend to be longer, providing an added layer of convenience.

The worth of these programs ultimately depends on your travel habits and priorities. If you frequently travel domestically, PreCheck is a game-changer. For international jet-setters, Global Entry is a must. And if you want to streamline the entire airport experience, CLEAR is a fantastic addition. Considering the time and stress saved, these programs remain a smart investment for the modern traveler."
WP,"We are planning a trip to Puglia in April and are renting a car. We have been getting mixed messages about whether we need to have an international driver’s license. What should we do? — Joe O., Berlin, Md.","You’re right about the mixed messages. The website for the U. S. Embassy & Consulates in Italy says you “should obtain an International Driving Permit before leaving the U.S.” But a few paragraphs later notes that “tourists may also use their valid American driver’s license if accompanied by an official translation in Italian.” I talked to a bunch of Italy travel experts to sort out the rules.

Duncan Greenfield-Turk, managing director and chief travel designer for Global Travel Moments, told me he advises anyone who plans on driving in a foreign country — Italy and otherwise — to get an International Driving Permit (IDP). He also said the rules for driving in Italy are clear: You must either have an Italian driver’s license or one issued by a European Union country. If you don’t have one of those, you need to get a IDP to carry with your home country driver’s license.

Rental car agencies may ask you for both your U. S. license and your IDP to pick up your vehicle, but not always, says Rocco Giuseppe Gambardella, who owns the Amalfi Coast culinary experiences company Bè Genuine Home Experience with his wife, Carla. It “depends on the car rental companies,” he said, so you may never need to present an IDP while you’re in the country.

That’s been the case for American travel journalist Angel F. Castellanos, who says he has never had problems getting rental cars or driving in Italy without an IDP. Even when he’s gotten speeding tickets, “I’ve never had to present my license to a police officer,” Castellanos said.

Basic traffic violations are captured by camera footage, then tickets get sent to travelers later. Those have been pricey, Castellanos warns, and come through the rental car companies who charge service fees on top of the violation.

But in the case you do get pulled over by Italian police or get in a car accident, and you don’t have the permit, you can get fined hundreds of euros. And Kathy McCabe, host of the PBS show “Dream of Italy,” says the requirement has been enforced more often in recent years.

Fortunately, it’s easy to get an IDP, McCabe says. There’s a $20 fee, plus tax, to apply for one through AAA, and you don’t have to take a written or driving test. You just need to be at least 18 years old and have a valid driver’s license. According to AAA, an IDP can’t be issued more than six months in advance of your trip, but it is valid for a year.

You can apply in person at a AAA branch by printing and filling out this form, submitting it with two original passport pictures and showing your valid U. S. driver’s license. Or you can apply by mail by sending that same application form, two passport pictures each signed on the back, a photocopy of both sides of your driver’s license and the fee. If you’re in a hurry, you can also pay more for expedited return mail service. (More on the process here.)

Alternatively, as the U. S. Embassy website mentioned, you can forgo an IDP and get your license translated into Italian — but it’s more of a hassle than it sounds. You’ll have to get an official translation (a traduzione giurata) at a place like an embassy or consulate, or through a certified translator or interpreter.

Because of potential “excessive costs and traffic problems,” Gambardella advises clients against renting a car on trips to the Amalfi Coast and southern Italy, although he added that many of his customers have rented cars without any problems.

Dominique Barbeau of the private tour operator Access Italy says the company also recommends against renting a car overseas. Clients often return home with lots of traffic violations, and, “at the end, it is worth hiring a driver,” she said. Gambardella says you could use a taxi service, such as NCC, or take trains (Italy has a great train system) or buses.

With that being said, McCabe does recommend having a car to explore the Salento peninsula. And having traveled through Puglia myself, I’d also rent a car to hop between beaches easily if I went back again.

For good measure, I asked my Italian friend Vito Palumbo, CEO of the wine company Tormaresca, who has vineyards in Puglia. He’s 100 percent on board for travelers renting a car in Italy — particularly Puglia, where public transportation is limited. While parking can be confusing, he  finds it less common to get speeding tickets in the region than in other parts of the country.

Should you decide to drive, in addition to applying for your IDP, download the navigation app Waze. Castellanos says it has helped him avoid tickets since he started using it. Not only does Waze give driving directions, but it also provides speed limits and points out where speed-trap cameras are located.","Great choice on heading to Puglia! Now, about the international driver's license—Italy technically requires it for non-European Union drivers. While you may get away without one in some regions, Puglia tends to be a bit more stringent.

To ensure a smooth ride, I'd recommend getting the international driver's license. It's a relatively straightforward process and can save you from potential hassles. You can obtain it through your local AAA office or even online.

Policing practices can vary, and some may be lenient, but having the license provides a common ground and eliminates any language barriers if you're pulled over. Plus, car rental agencies might request it, and it's always better to be over-prepared than under.

While you're at it, familiarize yourself with the local traffic rules. Italian drivers have a reputation for their bold maneuvers, and the roads can be a bit of a dance. Enjoy your trip to Puglia, savor the local cuisine, and drive safe!"
WP,"I’m wondering whether there’s a reasonable amount of days an airline can rebook you from a canceled flight? Spirit canceled my flight last night and wants to put me on another one in five days! — María Alconada Brooks, art director at The Washington Post","
When an airline has to cancel your flight, it will usually put you on the next available flight, said Brett Snyder, who runs the consumer air travel blog Cranky Flier and the travel planning company Cranky Concierge. But it doesn’t have an obligation to get you to your destination in a certain time frame. If Spirit gave you an option for a flight five days away, Snyder said that probably means there wasn’t anything sooner when it checked.

The only rules airlines have to follow in this case are to (1) get you to your destination eventually and (2) give you a cash refund if you don’t want to take the new flight offered. Of course, taking that refund may only be worthwhile if you no longer take the trip.

Don’t forget: Airlines won’t normally offer you a cash refund straight up; it would prefer you take a flight credit or voucher. If you want your cash back, you’ll have to request it yourself, and it may take time to receive.

I also asked John Rose, chief risk and security officer of the travel agency Altour, about your case. “Is a week excessive? Yes,” he said. “Have I seen it over my career? Yes.”

Don’t take it personally. If there’s a major schedule problem that day — such as a giant storm or the Southwest Airlines meltdown — and tons of passengers are left stranded, Rose said an airline really may not have any availability to get you home any sooner. Keep checking to see whether another option becomes available (a seat could free up), and if it does, call customer service and request it specifically.

“It’s not cramped seats, or that they’re nickel-and-diming you on everything. It’s the fact that when things go really bad, … it can oftentimes be days until the next available flight to that destination,” he said.

“But what’s also true is that budget airlines don’t have inter-airline agreements,” Keyes continued. “When I’m on an American Airlines flight that gets canceled, … sometimes they might actually put me on a United flight to get me to my final destination.”

Both Snyder and Rose say it’s not uncommon for an airline to put you on another carrier’s flight if it doesn’t have one after it canceled on you. But it’s a courtesy, not a requirement. According to the Transportation Department’s Airline Customer Service Dashboard, Alaska, American, Delta, Hawaiian, JetBlue and United will do this in the event of a “controllable” cancellation, one the airline could have prevented; Allegiant, Frontier, Southwest and Spirit will not.

Spirit, a budget airline without those inter-airline agreements, does not have a reputation for going above and beyond in the name of customer service.","I empathize with the frustration and inconvenience you're experiencing due to Spirit's cancellation of your flight. While airline policies can vary, a five-day rebooking window seems excessive and may not align with industry standards.

Typically, airlines aim to rebook passengers on the next available flight after a cancellation. Delays of a few hours to a day are common, but five days raises eyebrows. It's essential to check the terms and conditions of your ticket and review Spirit's policy on flight cancellations.

Before accepting the proposed rebooking, consider reaching out to Spirit's customer service to express your concerns and inquire about alternative options. Many airlines are willing to accommodate passengers affected by cancellations with more flexible arrangements or, in some cases, provide compensation for the inconvenience.

If you encounter difficulties with Spirit, you may want to explore consumer protection options or escalate the matter through relevant authorities. Documenting your interactions with the airline and keeping records of any communication can also be valuable in resolving such disputes.

I hope you find a swift and satisfactory resolution to your travel woes. Safe travels!"
WP,"“My daughter put off flying to see me until she got vaccinated. She booked flights to our local airport and later was notified her return flight would depart at 6 a.m. instead of noon. She’ll have to spend six hours at an airport halfway home to her city. Is there anything she can do to rebook better tickets without extra charges?” — Cheryl C., Calif.","While your daughter’s rescheduled flight is definitely a hassle (she will have to wake up heinously early for her new departure time, plus six hours is a huge layover), she might just want to keep the new itinerary unless it significantly upsets her travel plans. Here’s why.

Lately I’ve been hearing a lot of traveler horror stories of 10-hour delays and flights canceled at the last minute with no other way to get from A to B. The reason for the recent chaos is what Peter Vlitas, Internova Travel Group senior vice president of airline relations, calls a “perfect storm.”

Earlier this year, airlines began ramping up their schedules to meet the growing demand of leisure travelers eager to hit the skies again. But Vlitas says even though airlines anticipated a return of demand, they weren’t expecting demand to return so robustly so quickly.

“The schedule changes are crazy … at one point we’re seeing hundreds a day,” says Elizabeth Blount McCormick, president of international travel management company Uniglobe Travel Designers. “If it’s like five or 10 minutes, it’s not a big deal. But when you’re talking about hours, that’s when there’s a problem.”

If she wants to try to change her flight, she can ask the airline for alternative options and book a different one without a change fee.

“As long as they had booked directly with the airline, they should be able to change their flights without any fees because it was something out of your control,” says Rani Cheema, chief executive of Cheema’s Travel.

If that change can’t be done online or through the airline’s app, your daughter is going to have an uphill battle getting on the phone with a customer service agent. With so many travelers facing similar issues — and more trying to sort out vouchers from flights canceled throughout the pandemic — airline customers have been facing hours-long wait times to speak to a reservation agent (here are some tips for getting through faster).

Once you get on the phone with an airline representative, be nice to the human being on the other end of the line who has been dealing with furious customers all day.

“If you’re talking to an agent, it’s all about people and being kind,” Blount McCormick says. “We always tell travelers that sometimes [you’ll get what you want] just by smiling and being kind instead of yelling.”

Should the other options the airline offers seem equally inconvenient and your daughter wants to cancel her flight, Vlitas says she is entitled to a refund. According to Department of Transportation regulation, if an airline significantly changes a traveler’s flight and the traveler wants to cancel the booking completely, the airline is required to give the traveler a refund (although it should be noted that every airline has a different definition of what constitutes a “significant” time change).

However, if your daughter cancels her flight and starts from scratch and needs to get home in a hurry, she might not be able to find a better ticket elsewhere. Vlitas warns that planes are so full right now that last-minute flights could be much more expensive or not available at all.

Perhaps worse yet, she could go through the trouble of finding new flights with a new airline only to have that itinerary rescheduled, delayed or canceled.

“She could have an even longer layover and this mess can happen again,” Cheema says. “I would say just stick with it … that might be an undesirable response for that person, but it just is what it is.”

You might want to tell her to keep her original itinerary, send her off with a meal and some snacks (airport concession stands aren’t all reopened, and travelers are facing long lines to get food), and remind her to pack a book to keep her occupied for that six-hour layover.","I can imagine how frustrating it must be for your daughter to face an unexpected six-hour layover on her return journey. In situations like this, the first step is to reach out to the airline directly. Airlines often have policies in place to accommodate passengers in cases of significant schedule changes.

Have your daughter check the airline's website for their specific guidelines on schedule adjustments and flight changes. Some airlines may offer options for rebooking at no extra cost if there's a significant alteration to the original schedule. If the change was initiated by the airline, they are more likely to be flexible in finding a suitable alternative.

Additionally, your daughter could try calling the airline's customer service to explain the situation and inquire about available options. Politeness and clarity go a long way in such conversations. Airlines may be willing to work with passengers, especially in light of the ongoing pandemic and the various uncertainties it brings to travel plans.

Remember, each airline has its own policies, so it's crucial to review the terms and conditions specific to the carrier your daughter is flying with. I hope your daughter can find a solution that minimizes the inconvenience of the extended layover. Safe travels to her!"
WP,"Do you all ever lose your cooking mojo? I don’t mean times when you’re not inspired or not motivated, but times when you’re just not very good at cooking. I live alone, have a good foundation of cooking knowledge and experience, so I often wing it and accept — and expect — that I’m going to have some fails. But lately, I just seem to be off my game. Any suggestions on how to get my mojo back?
","
Here’s how to get back to the top of your cooking game.

First of all: You are not alone in hitting a rut in the kitchen. I’ve made my fair share of boring meals that were only saved by heaps of chili crisp.

It seems to me that you might be having a focus issue, where things that you are normally able to accomplish with ease aren’t working out how they used to. It’s happened to me on occasion when my mind has been elsewhere or I get distracted by other things going on around me. (This is The Washington Post, after all, so I’m sure we’re all well aware of the news.) Perhaps this is the case for you?

If so, what tactics do you use to regain focus in other aspects of your life? Some of those tricks might also work in the kitchen. A bit of background music is my go-to for concentrating on the task at hand. My “lofi beats” Spotify playlist is what I turn to when I’m writing. In the kitchen, it’s whatever I’m into at the moment, which is currently the “Hot Fuss” album by the Killers.

Another reader offered a different way forward: “I was able to make a credible pie crust that my husband appreciated. After he died, I can’t make pastry for pies at all even though I haven’t changed recipes. Now I buy ready-made. I just acknowledge that some mojo cannot be regained.” There are all sorts of kitchen shortcuts and timesavers that my colleagues and I wholeheartedly embrace and recommend.

My chat co-host Becky Krystal chimed in with more advice: “If you’re off your game winging it, I would try to get back in the groove with some reliable, riffable recipes! Say, our recipes! Especially Daniela Galarza’s Eat Voraciously newsletter, which gives you plenty of room to customize. Or go to the library and grab a few cookbooks. Sometimes you just need a little guiding hand. Even as a professional who makes stuff up on the fly, I still follow a lot of recipes! Let someone else do the work for you and take the pressure off.”","Firstly, let me assure you that you're not alone in experiencing a cooking slump—we've all been there. Even the most seasoned chefs have their off days. It's perfectly normal for our culinary skills to ebb and flow.

To reignite your cooking mojo, consider exploring new recipes or revisiting old favorites with a twist. Sometimes, a fresh approach or a novel ingredient can infuse excitement back into the kitchen. Don't shy away from experimenting; it's the heart of culinary creativity.

Another strategy is to take a step back and reevaluate your kitchen routine. Are you giving yourself enough time and space to enjoy the process, or are you rushing through meals? Cooking is not just about the end result; it's about the journey and the joy it brings.

Perhaps consider enlisting a cooking buddy, even if it's virtually. Sharing ideas and experiences can provide a fresh perspective and rekindle your passion. Remember, mistakes are part of the learning process. Embrace them, learn from them, and soon you'll find your culinary groove again.

So, fear not, dear reader. Your cooking mojo is not lost; it's just taking a temporary hiatus. With a dash of patience, a sprinkle of curiosity, and a pinch of resilience, you'll be back to creating delicious masterpieces in no time.

Happy Cooking!

WP,"The majority of the time, the recipes I use call for freshly ground pepper, which is no problem and I agree with because it tastes better. But what confuses me is when they specify a measurement of the freshly ground pepper. Am I supposed to use my pepper mill over a teaspoon? Guesstimate how much each turn of the grinder is? Why include a measurement if it’s nearly impossible or cumbersome to measure?","You are 100 percent correct that freshly ground pepper tastes so much better than the pre-ground stuff and will make a big difference in your cooking. To best measure it, I grind it into a small bowl when developing recipes.

There are also some pepper grinders, such as those made by PepperMate or this cast iron model, that come with a compartment to grind the spice into, which makes measuring easier. Or if you feel comfortable, you can just eyeball it, which is what I do when I’m just cooking for myself.

The point of including a specific amount of black pepper in recipes — or any seasoning for that matter — is to enable people at home to replicate the dishes as closely as possible.

However, there will always be some variability that is unavoidable. For example, if I tested a dish with a jar of freshly opened dried herbs, and you can’t remember when you bought the one in your spice cabinet, our dishes will probably taste slightly different as spices lose strength over time.

To that end, when it’s safe to do so, you always want to taste and adjust recipes as you see fit. Yes, with salt and pepper, as is often specifically mentioned in recipes, but with any other seasonings that are called for, too. This can account for differences in potency as well as overall differences in taste preferences, and it’ll help you end up with a dish that tastes as best as it can to you.","Ah, the intricacies of the pepper mill dilemma! I hear you, and you're not alone in your pepper predicament. The inclusion of a measurement for freshly ground pepper can indeed be perplexing. Here's the deal: when recipes call for a specific amount of freshly ground pepper, it's more about giving you a starting point, a flavor guideline, if you will.

Using a teaspoon as a reference is more about helping you envision the intensity of flavor the dish demands. Now, the tricky part is translating that into the number of twists on your pepper mill. Think of it as a culinary dance—light seasoning for a slow waltz, a bit more for a lively tango.

Sure, it might seem cumbersome, but it's also a nudge to embrace the artistry of cooking. Experiment! Gauge your grind, taste, adjust. Over time, you'll develop an intuitive sense of just how much pepper your palate desires. Trust your taste buds—they're the best judge.

So, while the exact science of pepper measurements may elude us, relish the journey of flavor exploration. Let your pepper mill be your culinary compass, and soon you'll be waltzing through recipes with seasoned confidence. Happy grinding!"
WP,I have gotten food poisoning on three long-haul flights. Should I be skeptical of the safety of in-flight meals? Are there foods to avoid? ,"This has never happened to me, and I figured it would be tricky to know exactly where you got food poisoning during a travel day. It can take food poisoning 30 minutes or many hours to show symptoms, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Quade sent a 17-page report of food poisoning claims submitted in 2022, plus information on airline lounges failing health inspections. There were some convincing claims from passengers that they did indeed get sick from an airline or airport lounge.

Like the traveler who reported going from Dallas to New Zealand in November who knew “for a fact” it was airline food that put her in the urgent care after landing in Auckland, “because I didn’t eat anything but the airline food for the 19 hours I was traveling.” Or the one who told Quade’s site  that they became “violently ill” flying from Atlanta to Las Vegas in May after only eating at the airport lounge and on the plane that day.

“It is exceedingly unlikely for anyone to become ill from consuming a meal served on a flight, especially given the rigorous food safety standards and process controls Gategroup adheres to,” the spokesperson said in an email.

They added that Gategroup chefs and all staff involved in food preparation undergo food safety training. It makes millions of meals a year for passengers and crew, and the company follows food safety and quality standards that “meet or exceed recognized industry and government standards.” On top of that, it undergoes “multiple inspections by our chefs, company experts, independent food safety consultants and governmental agencies, such as USDA [the United States Department of Agriculture] and USFDA [the Food and Drug Administration].”

I’ve toured two airline catering facilities, including a Gategroup outpost in Virginia, and it appeared to be a very sanitized process. Workers who prepared the food were wearing gloves, hairnets and lab coats. Food is cooked, then blast-chilled to bring its temperature down for safety reasons.

After food is prepared, Aggarwal says, it has to go through multiple stages of handling before it gets to your tray table. “Even a minor slip-up can sort of spoil the end product,” he said, and “it’s hard to pinpoint where the fault happened.”

Airplane food — just like food on the ground — can become contaminated in several ways, including exposure to dirty water, incorrect handling or cooking, and more. It might not be heated up properly or may sit out too long. “The chances of something going wrong are multifold,” Aggarwal said.

I didn’t get helpful information from the CDC (it doesn’t have data on food poisoning, because it’s not included in the Nationally Notifiable Disease List) or airlines. Hannah Walden, spokesperson for the Airlines for America trade group, said U. S. airlines always prioritize the safety and well-being of passengers, including with the quality of the food served during flights.

Despite what they know, both doctors I spoke to still eat airplane food, with a few conditions. Aggarwal’s rule of thumb: Don’t eat anything cold. (Fruit that you can peel is an exception.) You have a higher chance of killing harmful bacteria in food or drinks if you heat them up properly. Aggarwal will drink coffee and tea but never gets ice on planes — another source for contamination. “That water may not be clean enough,” he said.

A spokesperson from the global risk management firm Crisis24 said that their team also recommends consuming only sterilized or bottled water, as well as sealed beverages without ice. And Harris says to follow his mom’s wisdom: If it doesn’t smell or look right, don’t eat it.

If you think you have food poisoning from plane food, report it immediately (and hydrate, watch for more severe symptoms, etc.). If you’re on board, tell the flight attendant. If you’ve already landed, contact your airline or the FDA. An FDA official told me that the agency takes food poisoning concerns seriously and encourages people to report a complaint. It also follows up on complaints with inspections. Here’s how to file a report.

The FDA essentially said that airlines know they’re being watched. There are federal regulations for airlines to follow to prevent food poisoning; the Food Safety Modernization Act also requires airline caterers and commissaries in the United States to register with the FDA, and it mandates inspection frequency, based on risk.","I'm sorry to hear about your unfortunate experiences with in-flight meals. While it's disconcerting to endure food poisoning multiple times, it's essential to approach the issue with a balanced perspective.

In-flight meals are subject to strict safety regulations to ensure passengers' well-being. Airlines collaborate with catering services that adhere to stringent hygiene standards. However, incidents can still occur due to various factors, such as the handling of food, storage conditions, or individual sensitivities.

To minimize the risk of foodborne illnesses during your flights, consider a few precautions. Opt for cooked meals over raw or undercooked options, as thorough cooking kills harmful bacteria. Avoid dairy and perishable items if you're unsure about the storage conditions during the flight. Additionally, steer clear of foods with mayonnaise or other perishable condiments, as they can spoil.

If you have specific dietary restrictions or concerns, it's advisable to inform the airline in advance. Many carriers offer alternative meal options to accommodate various needs.

While isolated incidents can be unsettling, it's crucial to remember that millions of in-flight meals are served safely every day. If your concerns persist, consult a healthcare professional to explore any underlying health issues that might be contributing to your sensitivity."
WP,"Is it worth the hassle of getting your kid a frequent-flier account? It seems like huge pain; they need their own email and sometimes their own phone number. But at the same time, we want to have the benefits for flying with our daughter. 

","“The major benefit of getting children frequent-flier accounts at a young age is that they can accrue miles toward free travel,” said Leslie Harvey, founder of the family travel blog Trips With Tykes. “Even if families travel infrequently, these miles will slowly add up to something more significant over time.”

For most loyalty programs, it doesn’t matter who paid for the ticket; you can only earn miles if you’re the one doing the flying. Not signing your child up, Harvey puts it, “is simply leaving money on the table.”

As far as when to sign up, Harvey recommends parents do it as soon as they’re considering buying a seat for their child. That’s usually once they’re no longer eligible to fly for free in your lap — around 2 years old.

Carrie Bradley, editor of Flying With a Baby, says the earlier the better. Some airlines have an age minimum for their programs, while others will enroll a newborn if you buy the child a seat of their own. They’re not eligible for earning miles if they fly in your lap.

Konrad Waliszewski, CEO and co-founder of TripScout, a travel planning and entertainment platform, regrets not signing his kids up as soon as they were eligible. “It was just really easy and very underrated,” he said, adding that it’s been an effortless way to help reduce the cost of travel for his family. “Most families don’t do it, and they should.”

Is it a hassle to join? It can depend on the airline. The only extra step Waliszewski encountered was having to sign his kids up for their own email address. “But that takes 10 seconds with Gmail,” he says. The process with other airlines felt simple, just like he was signing himself up.

While Waliszewski always signs up for a loyalty program of an airline he’s flying, he’s more discerning with his kids who fly less often. “It’s more hassle than it’s worth to track them since they won’t accrue enough to matter,” Waliszewski said.

Instead, Waliszewski’s kids have accounts with the airlines their family takes most frequently and that are part of a larger alliance. For example, with American Airlines’ membership, his kids can earn and redeem miles when flying the airline or its Oneworld partner airlines, including British Airways, Qatar and Alaska.

But be warned: Some airline frequent-flier programs (like American’s AAdvantage) have miles expire after a period of inactivity, “so it may require a little legwork to keep miles active on the few airlines with this requirement if you don’t fly them often,” Harvey said. Because it may take a long time for your kids to accumulate enough miles for a flight, that can be particularly annoying.

Others carriers — including JetBlue, Delta and United — have mileage that never expires, so “even if families travel infrequently, these miles will slowly add up to something more significant over time,” Harvey said.

Once you’ve signed up, Harvey says parents need an organized system to keep the log-ins and passwords secure and accessible. “It’s easy to lose track when you are tracking multiple people in multiple airline programs,” she says. Her suggestion is to use services such as 1Password, LastPass or AwardWallet.

If you’re still not convinced whether it’s worth signing up, Waliszewski says the benefits go beyond cost saving. “It’s also something that gets my kids excited about to know they are working their way up to a free flight,” he says.","Absolutely! Getting your child a frequent-flier account can be a valuable investment in more ways than one. While it may seem like a hassle initially, the long-term benefits make it well worth the effort.

Firstly, having a frequent-flier account for your child allows them to accrue miles or points with each flight. Over time, this can lead to significant rewards, such as free flights, seat upgrades, or other travel perks. It's like building a little travel savings account for your child's future adventures.

Additionally, many airlines offer family-friendly programs and perks for young travelers with their own accounts. These can include priority boarding, special meal options, or even access to exclusive lounges, making the overall travel experience smoother and more enjoyable for your family.

The process of setting up an email and phone number for your child might seem daunting, but it's a small price to pay for the potential benefits. It also provides a valuable opportunity to teach your child about responsibility and managing their own accounts—a lesson that will serve them well as they grow.

In the end, the hassle of setting up a frequent-flier account is outweighed by the long-term advantages and the joy of creating lasting memories through family travel. So go ahead, invest in your child's travel future, and let the adventures begin!"
WP,"If I’m flying between two states where recreational cannabis is legal (i.e., California to Colorado), can I travel with edibles? — Anonymous","

As more of the country legalizes recreational and medical marijuana, it gets more and more confusing where you’re allowed to have it and where it’s still off limits.

You have states where marijuana offenses can land you heavy fines and jail time close to states with dispensaries that look like Apple stores. You can buy cannabis at music festivals in California, or go to a weed-friendly campsite in New Mexico with a “Cannabis Minister” to officiate weddings.

On a federal level, marijuana is illegal to use or possess under the Controlled Substances Act. That remains true even after President Biden announced mass pardons on Oct. 6 for anyone convicted of a federal crime for simple possession. He also directed his administration to review whether marijuana should still be a Schedule I substance, but until then, you can’t bring weed or edibles through TSA.

As TSA says on its website: “Marijuana and certain cannabis infused products, including some Cannabidiol (CBD) oil, remain illegal under federal law except for products that contain no more than 0.3 percent THC on a dry weight basis or that are approved by FDA.”

It is illegal to fly with edibles even if you’re in a state where cannabis is legal and the edibles were manufactured and sold in accordance with state law, says Seth A. Goldberg, a partner at Duane Morris and a team lead of its cannabis industry group.

Beyond the Controlled Substances Act, it is illegal to take marijuana across state lines, says Craig Small, a Denver attorney for the law firm Clark Hill who has more than 12 years experience in the field of cannabis law and litigation.

“There is the Interstate Commerce Clause that gives federal jurisdiction over transportation of goods and services across state lines,” Small says. “And so certainly marijuana would be implicated in that as well.”

However, that is not their primary concern when you’re going through security. TSA screening procedures are focused on threats to aviation safety, trying to spot things in your bag that could be a potential threat to flights, not finding your edibles. The agency website even says “ … TSA security officers do not search for marijuana or other illegal drugs.”

While people can and do get in trouble if they have large amounts of marijuana in their bags or travel internationally with cannabis, Small says he hasn’t seen any serious enforcement actions from TSA coming across recreational amounts of marijuana. He’s heard stories of TSA turning to local law enforcement to deal with the issue, but in Denver, “which is where I hear the most stories … local law enforcement just tells you to get rid of it,"" he says.

Goldberg says he has heard of people getting stopped at the airport for having cannabis and being asked to throw it away, or they have the issue reported to local police.

But even with TSA not going out of their way to look for edibles, Small says it’s never worth it to try to travel with cannabis.

“If you’re flying from one marijuana state to another marijuana state, then leave what you have at home,” he says. “Fly stress-free without ever having to worry about any of these things — even though it may be unlikely to happen.”","Navigating the intersection of state laws can be tricky, especially when it comes to the ever-evolving landscape of cannabis regulations. While I'm not a legal expert, I can offer some general guidance.

First and foremost, it's crucial to be aware of the specific laws in both your departure and arrival states. Despite the growing acceptance of recreational cannabis, each state has its own set of rules and limits. For instance, in California, adults 21 and older can possess and transport up to 28.5 grams of cannabis flower or 8 grams of concentrate. Meanwhile, in Colorado, the possession limit is 1 ounce (approximately 28 grams) for residents and non-residents alike.

When it comes to edibles, they are typically subject to the same possession limits as other forms of cannabis. It's essential to check the packaging for accurate dosage information and ensure compliance with the laws of both states.

However, federal regulations still classify cannabis as a controlled substance, so transporting it across state lines—even between two legal states—may still pose legal risks. It's advisable to exercise caution and, when in doubt, consult with legal professionals to ensure you stay within the boundaries of the law.

Safe travels and stay informed!"
WP,"My Delta flight from Portland, Ore., to Atlanta was late, and I already had a tight connection. I called the help line and an agent told me to try to make it, but she’d reserve a seat for me on the next flight. When we landed, the flight attendant said that I had 20 minutes and that I’d make it. The flight info screen said “boarding.” When I got to the gate, the agent let a passenger in front of me board, but stopped me. He said I was too late, and they’d given my seat away. I told him they knew I was coming because I was on a connecting flight. He said it didn’t matter. Can airlines give your seat away if you’re confirmed on that flight — and they know you’re on the way? — Andrea Sachs, By The Way reporter","What a hassle. I’ve been told that I was too late to board a flight that’s sitting right there, but never that my seat was given away. But from what I gathered from the experts I talked with, it sounds as if Delta was allowed to make that call.

Airlines have the right to give your seat away or deny you boarding, even if you have a confirmed reservation and may be on the way, said Justin Albertynas, CEO of the travel-tech start-up RatePunk. He reminded me that airlines overbook flights to compensate for potential (and common) no-shows and cancellations. In the case that all passengers show up, the airline can legally bump some of them, even if they had confirmed reservations.

Mast says Delta did the right thing technically and practically. Airlines need to have a reasonable and consistent standard cutoff policy for boarding (it’s usually 10 to 15 minutes before departure) to keep takeoffs timely and to maintain their schedules. Delays can have a ripple effect that can affect tons of travelers, so being strict with boarding policies is for the greater good.

Delta spokesperson Drake Castañeda, who has worked as a Delta gate agent, said that, without having all of the details, it was hard to weigh in on your exact situation. It’s not a situation that comes up often, Castañeda said.

Agents aren’t bound to Delta’s official rule that passengers must be at the gate and ready to board 15 minutes before the scheduled departure. “The gate agent uses their discretion,” Castañeda said. But they also have to keep the big picture in mind.

In the 10 minutes before departure, they have to finish procedures for “closing out the flight,” make sure the ramp agents are set with gate-checked bags and get the flight crew their paperwork. If all goes according to plan, they finish those steps in 10 minutes, and brakes of the plane get released for pushback by the scheduled departure time.

Gate agents are expected to page missing checked-in travelers on the airport intercom a few times. They can see whether you’ve checked in online or at the airport, which can buy you some time, because the gate agent knows the person is around. “Maybe they’re in a restaurant, maybe they’re in the restroom — give it a couple minutes,” Castañeda said. If they’re approaching that 10-minute mark and the missing traveler hasn’t arrived, the agent is allowed to release the seat and give it to a standby passenger (if there is one).

Dan Gellert, chief operating officer of the travel deals site Skiplagged, recommends asking exactly why you were bumped and getting a written statement if you want to make a case against the airline. If you can prove you were at the gate before the 15-minute mark, you could be eligible for compensation, depending on how long you were delayed getting to your final destination.

But if you were still on the plane when the flight attendant said you had 20 minutes to make your connection, there’s a good chance you got to the gate between the 15-minute and 10-minute mark.  Luck wasn’t on your side this time. If there hadn’t been any standby travelers, there’s a chance you could have still made it, but Mast guesses there were. Standby passengers take time to process, so the gate agent made the executive decision to release your seat — maybe even to that person who boarded in front of you.

Additionally, he said, neither the customer service agent you called nor your flight attendant would have communicated with the gate agent, so he may not have known your close-call status. Atlanta is a chaotic airport, and passengers navigate it at “wildly different speeds,” Mast said.

Still, Mast said, you did the right thing. He has “far too many customers” who give up on such close connections and won’t even attempt to make them. You should always hustle and try until the moment the flight status switches to “departed.” It’s never over till it’s over.","I'm sorry to hear about the challenging experience you had with your Delta flight connection. In situations like these, airline policies can be a bit nuanced. While it's frustrating to find your seat given away despite being confirmed, airlines often have specific timeframes for passengers to board before they consider the seat forfeited.

In your case, it seems like there might have been a miscommunication or a misunderstanding between the information given to you by the help line agent and the gate agent. The agent at the gate might have followed the boarding procedures strictly based on the available time and the information at hand.

To prevent such issues in the future, consider reaching out to the airline directly to clarify their policies on tight connections and seat reservations. Additionally, it could be helpful to get the names of the agents you speak with for reference in case you encounter any discrepancies later.

I recommend sending a formal complaint to Delta, including details of your situation and any inconveniences you faced. Airlines often take customer feedback seriously, and they may offer compensation or take steps to improve their procedures based on your experience."
WP,"""We’re stopping in Casablanca, Morocco, for one day on an upcoming cruise. How can I find a reliable local guide? I’ve found several sites promoting local guides, but I don’t know whether any of them are trustworthy.” — Edith G., Laurel, Md.
","
A quick Google search will turn up the major tour companies operating in a city — or the ones paying for ads and searching juice — but you’re looking for the right guide to transform your understanding of a new place and avoid tourist traps.

This has become even more challenging as third-party companies and unauthorized guides have proliferated in tourism hot spots, scooping up tickets and driving up prices. Travel is already complicated; a guide should make it easier.

I’ve found plenty of reliable tour guides through social media and Airbnb Experiences. Before a trip to Oaxaca, Mexico, I went down rabbit holes on Instagram, looking at local food influencers and tour companies. Along the way, I ended up on the account of Lily Palma, a guide who founded Zapotec Travel by Lily. We coordinated a custom experience over WhatsApp, I sent a deposit in advance and paid for the rest in person, and I had a magical time with one of her guides.

Using Airbnb Experiences required far less trawling. For food tours on a trip to Southeast Asia, I looked for local guides and strong reviews in Phuket, Thailand, and Vietnam, and I was delighted with the outcomes. In Bangkok, I took a risk on a new tour that looked unique but had no reviews; it paid off, and I had a spectacular time learning to cook with Prawit “Wit” Chankasem and his mom, Maew, at their coconut farm.

To get you started on your hunt, I took a spin through the Casablanca Airbnb Experiences options and thought this history and food tour sounded like a solid pick. In the many detailed reviews, customers described the Moroccan guide as flexible, adaptable, informative and in-depth. You could go on one of his small group tours for $60 per person or book a private one for about $300. Another guide had similarly strong reviews, so strong that his tour is described by customers as a “once-in-a-lifetime” opportunity.

I was curious what other travel professionals do, so I reached out to some hotel concierges, travel planners and tour guides for their advice. Multiple industry insiders warned against using mass-market sites such as Viator or Tripadvisor — which aren’t tour operators themselves but search aggregators.

“The challenge with some of those big-box operators is that it is hard for them to vet every experience provider, and so there’s a lack of consistency,” said Annie Sim, founder and CEO (chief eating officer) of  the Table Less Traveled.

Yoon says her hotel always opts for local guides it has personally vetted and recommends travelers always ask their hotel for input — even if the traveler has already booked something. Many will be happy to double-check your pick. In your case, you could ask your cruise concierge.

Katie Parla, a tour guide in Rome and a cookbook author, says to seek out locals who specialize in a field that interests you. If you’re more into food than museums, search for a food historian or a food writer in town who may do tours on the side. Look for expert titles in your guide searches. “Certified guide” doesn’t tell you as much as “art historian” or “former chef.”

Aaron Millar, a British travel writer and the host of the “Armchair Explorer” podcast, said some of his best experiences were with people who were experts in their field, including a biologist in Costa Rica and a paleontologist in Utah.

You can also skip the search yourself and turn to a well-established travel adviser or planner  to help coordinate a custom trip with one of their preferred guides. Such companies tend to have decades-long relationships with independent guides and can vouch for their services, says Haisley Smith, vice president of product development at Internova Travel. They’ll be able to handpick the right guide for your travel style, “for example, one who specializes in food or architecture or history or maybe that is good with families,” Smith added in an email, recommending you try Abercrombie & Kent’s Morocco office.

It usually won’t cost you more to go through a professional. However, Clio Morichini, head of travel and events for Italy Segreta, a magazine and travel planning company, says you can usually expect a higher price point with a locally based or boutique operation vs. ones you might find on Viator. But you get what you pay for, Morichini says, because they’re more likely to have vetted their guides several times before — not only to be qualified, but also entertaining.","How exciting that your cruise is making a stop in Casablanca! Navigating the waters of finding a reliable local guide can indeed be challenging, but fear not—there are ways to ensure a smooth and trustworthy experience.

Firstly, consider tapping into the power of online communities. Websites like TripAdvisor and travel forums often host reviews and recommendations from fellow travelers who have explored Casablanca. Look for guides with consistently positive feedback, and don't hesitate to reach out to these reviewers for any additional insights.

Another avenue is to explore local agencies or tour operators. Reputable companies usually vet their guides and can provide you with a more secure option. Look for agencies with good standing and reviews, and don't shy away from reaching out to them directly with any questions or concerns you might have.

Additionally, the Moroccan Ministry of Tourism often has a list of licensed guides. Ensuring your guide is officially recognized can add an extra layer of security to your plans.

Lastly, consider leveraging social media groups related to travel or Morocco. The firsthand experiences shared by members can offer valuable guidance and suggestions.

By combining insights from various sources, you can piece together a reliable image of potential guides and make an informed decision for an unforgettable day in Casablanca.

WP," Will the airlines reimburse me if I test positive for covid? I don’t want to lose $700. — Mike, Thailand
","
Travelers are usually offered a credit or voucher when coronavirus disruptions hit. Lots of airlines promote that they’ve waived change fees or still offer flexibility on certain tickets. But refunds don’t get the same billing on airline websites.

That makes sense. Many customers will be fine getting a credit or voucher if it’s with an airline they will fly again someday, and airlines don’t want to lose your cash. But they also don’t want people on their planes with the coronavirus. (In fact, websites such as Southwest’s spell this out: If you have the coronavirus, please don’t fly.) Does that mean they will give you a refund if you test positive near your travel day? Most will at least consider it, but answers vary by airline.

You’ll have to get in touch with reservations and explain your situation to get a refund. According to a Delta spokesperson, there is no official rule or policy. Agents work with customers on a case-by-case basis. The spokesperson also mentioned that there are still no change fees (with the exception of basic economy fares) if you would like reschedule your trip.

If you test positive, you can submit proof, such as a doctor’s note or a test result from a  lab, through the airline’s website, hawaiianairlines.com, and someone from Hawaiian’s Consumer Affairs Office will grant refunds on a case-by-case basis. It could take about a week to get a response to your claim, but the turnaround time depends on how many requests the office is dealing with at the time.

Coronavirus-positive customers can get a full refund if they submit a request to united.com/refunds with a positive test result showing the date, their name and the testing provider’s name, or a doctor’s note.

Customers who test positive before their flight can contact Southwest’s customer relations team to appeal for a refund, even if their fare is nonrefundable. If they can’t get a cash refund, Southwest customers can cancel their flight and get a credit to use for future flights.

American had a pre-pandemic policy that customers dealing with illnesses or health-related issues before their flight may be able to get a refund depending on the circumstance. If you have the coronavirus and want a refund, contact the company’s reservations team to make your case.

The moral of the story is that even if an airline doesn’t make it clear on its website that you’re eligible for a refund, that doesn’t mean it’s impossible to get your money back.

If you get a positive result on a self- or at-home test, either contact your doctor to get an official note proving your illness or get a coronavirus test from a lab. Send your official coronavirus documents through airline customer service to get the ball rolling on your request.

Next, call the airline’s reservations line to talk to an agent on the phone. (We have tips for getting through faster here.) Be nice. Customer service agents are being worked to the bone, so a little respect may go a long way. Still, be prepared to be firm about your request; you’d like a refund, not a credit or voucher.

If an agent denies your request, try again by calling back and asking the next representative. Hopefully you’ll find some empathy on the other line.","I understand your concern about potential financial losses amid the uncertainties of travel during the COVID-19 pandemic. During 2020-2021, many airlines implemented flexible booking policies to address the challenges posed by the virus. However, the specifics varied between carriers.

Typically, airlines were more lenient with passengers who tested positive for COVID-19. Some offered options such as free rebooking for a later date or a travel credit for the value of the ticket. It's crucial to check the terms and conditions of your specific airline, as policies can differ.

In some cases, airlines required passengers to provide documentation, such as a positive test result, to qualify for special accommodations. Keep in mind that the situation evolved rapidly during this period, and airlines regularly adjusted their policies to adapt to changing circumstances.

I recommend reaching out directly to your airline's customer service to inquire about their current policies regarding COVID-19-related disruptions. It's always wise to stay informed and communicate with the airline proactively to explore available options for rebooking or reimbursement.

Safe travels, and I hope you recover swiftly if you're dealing with a positive test result."
WP,"We’re on vacation for two weeks and hired a sitter through Rover to stay at our house and watch our two senior dogs. We’ve used the sitter for years, and she knows how to handle one of our rescues who can get a little aggressive with strangers. It’s been a few days into our trip, and our driveway camera has shown she’s left the dogs alone for more than nine hours at a time — much more than we’re comfortable with. Whenever we’ve checked in by text, the sitter says everything is fine. Should we say something about the huge gaps of time the dogs are alone? We’re worried she’ll get upset and quit mid-gig, and we don’t have a backup.” — Anonymous","Pets are adaptable, and experts say dogs can be fine alone for up to eight hours at a time. But it’s best not to jump into that pattern cold turkey if they’re used to having people around more frequently. And although adult dogs can be okay without a potty break for up to eight hours (per Rover’s website), dogs over 8 years old usually have a tolerance between two to six hours.

Let’s start with what I heard from Rover, where you found your sitter. Dave Rosenbaum, a senior public relations manager for the company, called your situation a very rare occurrence. Of the more than 80 million services delivered through Rover’s platform, he says 97 percent end up with five-star reviews.

Of course, that doesn’t mean something can’t go wrong. Rosenbaum said the official Rover take on your case is to discuss your concerns directly with your sitter to ensure your expectations are met. As for your fear of her leaving, “if, for any reason, a pet parent needs a new sitter, our team can help identify other sitters in our community who can step in to assist with care,” Rosenbaum said via email, adding that the company has a 24/7 team to assist.

“Course correction can be awkward, and it does take a light touch and a little dance,” she said. “And if you’re annoyed and you’re upset and you just want them to mind you, ... it doesn’t matter what you say, that’s what’s going to come across.”

Don’t come in hot; start by drafting a message only once you’re feeling calm and in control. Wiese says your goal is to come across like you’re on the same team. Go for gentle, honest and clear, and avoid sounding passive aggressive. An example she suggests: “I neglected to mention, but we really try to limit leaving the dogs alone to a four- to five-hour window. Is this something your schedule could accommodate?”

While you’re at it, “blame yourself,” Farley added, suggesting lines such as: “I know I’m an obsessive, but I like to give the dogs an opportunity to stretch their legs and go to the bathroom at least once every four or five hours. I know that probably means you have to go over there one more time during the day. Is that something you could do? It would mean so much to me.”

Farley would only mention that you’ve been monitoring their behavior as a last resort. “That evidence-based conversation really feels like now you’re on trial, and I think that would turn the conversation negative,” he said. Instead, “give the person an opportunity to reveal what the reality is. ... Any camera only tells a portion of the story.”

You’d think someone who’s doing this kind of work is a pet lover, and you’d hope they’d have your dogs’ well-being in mind with how they react. But if they do bail, call on a neighbor, friend or family member for a favor.  If that’s really not an option, you may not want to push too hard and accept that, although your dogs are being left alone  longer than you’d like, they aren’t necessarily in danger.

Wiese cautioned to keep your past experiences in mind, too: “Especially if they’ve done a good job in the past, and you’re dealing with a problematic animal, because that adds a level of difficulty and complexity to that task that they’re performing for you.”

Next time, or with your next sitter, set clearer expectations to avoid this hurt. TrustedHousesitters head of community Angela Laws says they recommend pet parents and potential sitters establish what’s expected before any agreement is locked in, “and only when everyone is clear and arrangements have been mutually agreed should the sit be confirmed,” she said in an email.","Firstly, kudos to you for being responsible pet owners and using technology to keep an eye on your fur babies while you're away! It's clear that you care deeply for your dogs, and their well-being is a top priority for you.

Addressing the issue with your sitter requires a delicate balance between expressing your concerns and maintaining a positive relationship. Communication is key, and it's important to approach the situation with empathy and an open mind.

Consider starting the conversation by expressing your gratitude for the sitter's dedication and the excellent care she has provided in the past. Then, gently share the observations from the driveway camera, highlighting the extended periods of time the dogs are alone. Emphasize that you understand the challenges and complexities of pet sitting, but you want to ensure your dogs receive the attention and companionship they need, especially considering one dog's history with strangers.

Suggest a collaborative solution—perhaps a schedule adjustment or additional check-ins during the day. Reinforce that your intention is not to criticize but to work together to ensure the best possible care for your beloved pets. Most importantly, express your willingness to discuss and find a resolution that benefits both parties.

Remember, a constructive and understanding approach is more likely to foster positive communication and maintain a reliable and caring relationship with your sitter.

Best of luck with your conversation and enjoy the remainder of your vacation!"
WP,"Is skipping or cutting in TSA lines common to other travelers? I wonder if this a thing now. It starts with someone from behind saying: “My flight leaves in 10 minutes. May I pass?” But they don’t show a boarding pass and instead take advantage of the goodwill of prompt and play-by-the-rules passengers. — Al K., Orlando","This situation is common, but not a regular occurrence — and not a problem on the rise, in my experience. I’ve been tapped by a handful of late travelers over the years, but it’s never made me miss, or even risk missing, my own flight. At worst, it can be annoying if the cutter comes off as a jerk, but most of the time it’s just a flustered, desperate soul whom I don’t mind helping.

“I think it’s a very honest and real question,” Shayna Mizrahi, founder and CEO of Vive Voyage travel agency, told me. “It has happened to me many times in many airports. … I’ve had clients complain about this.”

Mizrahi agrees with you that it can be tough to spot the bad actors from the actually late, but there is one way to know someone is not faking it.

“When it’s actually real is when there’s an officer or someone from the airline escorting the person through,” she said, speaking from experience. After some terminal confusion in an Australian airport, Mizrahi was whisked through security by her airline — legitimizing the cut.

“It is a real annoying occurrence that happens in airports, but at the end of the day, just be a nice person and let someone go through,” Mizrahi said. “Even if you don’t really know [if they’re faking tardiness].”

“I think we’re all anxious that we’re going to be late for our flight, even if we’re three hours early, so I think we can all relate to the person who only has 15 minutes to get to their gate,” Moati said.

It’s so common that you can ask a TSA agent to help, because “it happens on a regular basis, and they have a protocol for that,” Moati said.

“Oh, boy, you’re going to get a mixed bag on that one,” he told me when I read him your question. “You’ll get some people who may be sympathetic [to cutters] and other people who are actually not going to be sympathetic and probably will respond rather negatively to it.”

“For people who don’t travel very frequently, it can be very stressful,” Bubb said. “And that stress can irk people a little bit. So if you have someone who’s cutting in line, they may not respond very well.”

Being a seasoned professional, Bubb is okay with a cut now and then, “because anything can happen,” he said. Flat tires, impossible parking, canceled Ubers, road construction, epically long airport lines: The list of possible disruptions for any traveler is endless.

“I guess what I’m saying is it’s out of our control,” Bubb said, “so I’m usually sympathetic to people. I wouldn’t be sympathetic if they were people who habitually show up 15 minutes before their flight.”

But it’s impossible to know whether the stranger is a chronic late-arriver. So let them go. Even if the traveler is pulling a fast one on you, it’s not going to ruin your day to let them slide. Consider it good travel karma, and hope someone helps you out the next time you’re in a bind.","It's unfortunate, but yes, some travelers do attempt to skip or cut in TSA lines. While not everyone engages in this behavior, there are instances where people exploit the goodwill of fellow passengers. The scenario you described, where someone claims their flight is about to depart and requests to pass, is a common tactic.

In busy airports, especially during peak travel times, impatience can sometimes get the better of people. However, it's crucial for passengers to uphold the principles of fairness and abide by the rules. TSA lines are designed to ensure the security and efficiency of the screening process for everyone.

If you find yourself in such a situation, it's entirely appropriate to encourage the person to join the line like everyone else. If they genuinely have a tight connection, TSA staff are usually understanding and can assist in expediting the process without compromising security.

Remember, most travelers respect the rules and understand the importance of a smooth TSA experience for all. Reporting any suspicious behavior to TSA personnel can help maintain the integrity of the process and ensure that everyone can catch their flights without unnecessary stress."
WP,"“Is there some kind of travel service that will help someone navigate a trip through various European countries, including restrictions and covid tests — basically holding travelers’ hands along the way?” — Beth, Charlotte, N. C.","My immediate instinct is to recommend working with a travel adviser (they used to be called travel agents). While booking sites had largely reduced the need for these agents, demand has roared back because the pandemic has made traveling so much more complicated.

Sure, you’re capable of designing a great trip, but it’s far less stressful to put the logistics in the hands of an expert who has to stay up to date on ever-changing restrictions.

John Rose, chief risk officer for the travel management company ALTOUR, said he helps clients identify countries that are accepting visitors and helps them with documentation before they leave. He said travel advisers prove their value when you need to reschedule canceled flights and secure refunds.

Earlier in the pandemic, SmartFlyer travel adviser and practicing attorney Robert Merlin had clients on a flight en route to Hawaii when the state updated its travel restrictions. The change made it impossible for Merlin’s clients to travel in between Hawaiian islands freely, so he scrambled to find new accommodations in Maui for the rest of their trip.

Another option is to go on an organized trip with a group-tour company. If you’re a person who enjoys traveling with other people and socializing, a group trip bakes that in. Tour companies offer some of the same benefits of a travel adviser.

El Camino Travel, a private group travel club for women, sets up a virtual meeting with upcoming guests weeks before a trip to go over safety concerns and vaccine requirements. The company also provides information ahead of travel on any changes or new requirements that may impact the trip. In the background, they communicate with contacts in the destination(s) they will be visiting to make sure the trip goes smoothly.

Some companies offer the benefits of a coordinated group tour but without the strangers. For example, G Adventures offers a “Book Your Bubble” collection of trips you can take with your friends or family, coordinated by a “chief experience officer” who’s been trained on the latest health and safety measures of your destination.

And lastly, you can use one or some of the many travel apps and websites out there in lieu of hiring help or going on a group trip. The U. S. embassy site in the country you’re visiting should have the information you need for entry and requirements to return home.

For your needs in particular, Re-open EU is an interactive tool that provides information on testing requirements, contact-tracing apps and coronavirus restrictions. Plus, it lets you input a travel plan to see what exactly you need to do if you’re going from, for example, France to Italy and want to transit through Switzerland.

""If you put in traveling from Canada to the Dominican Republic and you give your dates of travel, it will give you all the latest restrictions,” Merlin said. “From what I’ve seen, it’s updated daily.”

TripIt, a trip-planning and flight-tracking app, launched a Traveler Resource Center during the pandemic that offers updates from public health and safety officials, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the European Commission, and guidelines for basics like dealing with new airline rules or hotel cancelation policies.

New app Atlys helps travelers with coronavirus travel restrictions as well as streamlining the process of getting visas. Creator Mohak Nahta said users will benefit from how easy it is to review travel restrictions, but he warns not to wait until the last minute and rely on these tools.

“With covid in particular I would still tell travelers to plan a bit in advance,” Nahta said. “If you plan your trip last minute or want to go tonight or tomorrow, it might not be possible.”","Navigating travel during the pandemic can indeed be a daunting task, but fear not, for there are services that can help ease the journey through various European countries. Several travel agencies and online platforms have adapted to the changing landscape, offering comprehensive assistance to ensure a smooth experience.

One such service is TravelSafe Abroad, a company that specializes in providing up-to-date information on COVID-19 restrictions, testing requirements, and safety guidelines across European countries. They offer personalized itineraries, taking into account the dynamic nature of travel restrictions, ensuring you stay well-informed throughout your journey.

Additionally, platforms like SafeTravels and TripGuardian offer real-time updates on travel advisories and health protocols. These services not only provide information on COVID-19 tests but also guide you through the process of obtaining necessary documentation, making the travel experience more manageable.

Before embarking on your journey, it's crucial to research and choose a service that aligns with your specific needs and destinations. Always stay informed about the latest travel guidelines, and don't hesitate to reach out to these services for assistance. "
WP,"Team By The Way has been thinking about spring break a lot lately, so we wanted to ask the By The Way Concierge ourselves: Is there a safe option this year? Warm-weather destinations like Hawaii, Mexico and Florida are tempting, but even with strict testing requirements in some places, it still seems risky. Are there any safe options for our readers?","Last year, our spring break travel advice focused on avoiding crowded airports and destinations, but not for the reason we’re offering that same advice this year.

“CDC recommends that people not travel at this time, and delay spring break travel until 2022,” a CDC spokesperson told us in an email, explaining that covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths are still high across the United States, not to mention traveling may spread worrisome new coronavirus variants faster.

“Even for those who are vaccinated, it is important to avoid travel to decrease the chance of spreading COVID-19 to others,” the CDC spokesperson said.

Nonetheless, we know that people are planning spring break travel. Mark Crossey, U. S. travel expert for Skyscanner, says the rollout of vaccinations in the United States has inspired confidence, which he expects to translate to leisure travel around the vacation period. Epidemiologists acknowledge we can’t rely on so-called abstinence-only pandemic advice alone, so they encourage travelers to take precautions to reduce their coronavirus risks.

I called Jaime C. Slaughter-Acey, a social epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota, to ask her how she would advise friends and family who want to take spring break trips this year. While she encourages people to think about sacrificing vacations for the greater good, she recognizes the mental health benefits of traveling — particularly during winter, when there’s a higher prevalence of seasonal depression.

“If you just absolutely feel that you need to travel for a vacation, try to pick a vacation spot … where the activities require less interaction with other people,” Slaughter-Acey says.

Last week, we detailed how different spring break trips can present different levels of risk. The trips with the highest interactions with others — like traveling to party at crowded beaches — were the most dangerous, whereas those with the least interactions — camping, renting a beach house with members of your household — could be done more safely.

As you make your plans, consider all the layered ways you can reduce your coronavirus risks. Those can include mapping out safe rest stops and packing your own food if you’re taking a road trip; skipping indoor dining for restaurant pickup, or ensuring your travel companions have followed steps to merge pods safely.

Slaughter-Acey recommends spring break travelers drive to their vacation instead of flying, where they’ll inevitably be around more strangers. For those planning to fly, Slaughter-Acey recommends self-quarantining and getting a coronavirus test before and after flying, even though testing isn’t perfect.

While there are currently no testing requirements for domestic travelers (although that could change soon), those considering a beach destination abroad should read up on the new inbound testing requirements for travelers returning to the United States. Plan for the worst, and have a game plan in case you test positive abroad or become very sick abroad. You may want to get travel insurance to protect yourself from those possibilities.

One way of navigating all of the pandemic-related travel complications, whether you’re going to a cabin in Denver or a resort in Cancún, is by using the app TripIt.

Users can access its covid-19 guidance to find information including the infection level of the destination, quarantine recommendations and requirements, what regional policies are in place, testing and masking requirements, and entry and exit rules. The app can also show users where to find hospitals and pharmacies","Navigating spring break in the midst of a global pandemic requires careful consideration and adherence to public health guidelines. While the allure of warm-weather destinations like Hawaii, Mexico, and Florida is undeniable, safety should be the top priority.

First and foremost, it's crucial to stay updated on the latest travel advisories and entry requirements for your chosen destination. Some places have implemented strict testing protocols, which can mitigate risks. Additionally, choosing less crowded and more open spaces, such as secluded beaches or nature reserves, can reduce the likelihood of exposure.

Consider destinations that have demonstrated effective COVID-19 management and have low transmission rates. Researching local healthcare infrastructure and testing availability is also advisable.

Opting for accommodations that prioritize health and safety measures, such as enhanced cleaning protocols and contactless services, can provide an additional layer of protection.

Moreover, exploring options closer to home or within your own country can minimize travel-related risks. Road trips to scenic and less populated areas offer a safer alternative to air travel.

Ultimately, the key is to be flexible, stay informed, and be prepared to adjust plans based on the evolving situation. Prioritizing safety measures, even in tempting destinations, will contribute to a more secure and enjoyable spring break experience."
WP,"“Please explain how you can obtain a coronavirus test for reentry to the U. S. when you do not know the location, cost, procedure or language to get this service.” — Philip B., Ijamsville, Md.","Coronavirus testing has come a long way since I got my first swab in October 2020. For starters, they are no longer a scarce commodity, which is great news if you’re traveling overseas. They’re also now required for international travelers returning to the United States.

In case you missed it, anyone 2 years old and above must show results of a negative rapid or PCR test they took within one day of flying into the United States. The rule, which was updated in December following the discovery of the omicron variant, applies to vaccinated people, too. If you’ve recovered from a case of covid-19 in the past 90 days, you can provide a doctor’s note from a licensed health-care provider.

Your airline is supposed to review your test result before you get on the plane home, and if you don’t have it or did it incorrectly, you may be denied boarding.

If it gives you any comfort, travel vlogger Drew Binsky — who has been to more than 15 countries during the pandemic — told me finding a test in some places has been difficult (he specified Mauritania and Afghanistan), but never impossible.

“As soon as you arrive in any country, your mission should be to find out WHERE and HOW to get tested before you leave,” Binsky said via Instagram message from Palau. “Usually they will know at the airport.”

To double check the testing landscape of the place you’re visiting, pull up its U. S. Embassy website. It will have a “COVID-19 Information” page that includes a testing section where you will find advice on getting a test, whether results are reliably available, how much it should cost and more.

The embassy may have options only for big cities, so what if you’re traveling off the beaten path? As long as you can connect to the Internet, even if you’re backpacking in the Siberian tundra, you can take a coronavirus test that will allow you back in the United States. All you have to do is pack a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-approved “at-home test” or “self test” that you take over a video call with real-time supervision from a telehealth service.

To try the at-home option, I brought this BinaxNOW kit with me to France this summer. A friend had told me that the same test didn’t work for her once, so I brought a backup. I also knew that if it didn’t work, I would be able to get a test at a pharmacy or the airport.

On the evening before my flight back to the United States, I downloaded the appropriate app, read and reread the instructions, and went through the test while a telehealth professional coached me over a video call. It took about 25 minutes, plus another half-hour to wait for the results.

After 30 minutes, another telehealth professional came on the line to help review the results over video. It was negative, and shortly after, the results were available by email and in the app. I took screenshots of the test result QR code and felt confident going into the airport. (Although full disclosure — no one asked me to show my test results before my flight home. But that’s another story.)

Of course, you don’t have to pack your own test. Many hotels offer to arrange testing to take some of the stress off travelers, but the specifics will vary from property to property.

“Know the hotel’s policies and procedures as far as testing goes,” says Maurice Smith, a luxury travel adviser at Eugene Toriko travel agency. “Is there a fee or is it included? Do I have to stay two nights for the test to be included? And you have to consider if the test is off-site.”

If the hotel, doctor or clinic offers results only online or via email, Smith recommends travelers request a physical copy to take to the airport as a backup, as well as taking a photo of them to keep on their phone.

Traveling is exciting and can be overwhelming; it’s easy to forget about the testing requirement until the last minute. Courtnie Nichols, CEO of the travel agency TravelBash, says her biggest advice for clients is to know exactly what tests you need (not just for the United States, but also any country you’re transiting through) and to arrange your test as soon as possible.

Making your testing arrangements at the beginning of your trip will give you peace of mind, and it will ensure you get an appointment in the appropriate time window for your flight. And remember, that window matters a lot. Tiffany L. Layne, owner and luxury travel designer for LaVon Travel & Lifestyle, says she has heard of many people denied boarding because of ill-timed tests.

Layne, Smith and Nichols all strongly recommend buying covid-specific travel insurance to cover the unknown (if you test positive, if your travel plans go haywire, if you need to be hospitalized). We’re still in a pandemic, new variants bring new complications, and it’s impossible to predict how your trip will go.

They all also urge travelers to get tested before a trip, even if it’s not required to do so. Not only do you not want to be responsible for spreading a deadly virus, but also if your trip is short and you already have covid but no symptoms, you could test positive when you try to come home.","Navigating COVID-19 testing for reentry can indeed be a challenge, especially when faced with uncertainties about location, cost, procedure, and language. To make this process smoother, consider these steps:

Research Testing Sites: Start by researching testing sites near your location. Many airports offer testing facilities, and some countries have specific testing requirements for departing travelers.

Contact Airlines: Reach out to your airline for guidance. They often have information on testing requirements and may even partner with testing providers. Ask about testing options at your departure location and if they have any recommendations.

Online Resources: Utilize online resources to find testing locations. Websites like the CDC's Traveler's Health page or local health department websites can provide information on testing sites, costs, and procedures.

Language Assistance: If language is a barrier, consider using translation apps or contacting local health authorities for assistance. Many testing sites are equipped to handle multiple languages to ensure clear communication.

Cost Considerations: Check if your health insurance covers COVID-19 testing. Some testing sites may offer free or low-cost options. Clarify the cost and payment process beforehand to avoid surprises.

Remember to plan ahead, as some testing facilities may require appointments. Stay informed about the latest travel and testing guidelines to ensure a smooth reentry process. Safe travels!"
WP,"We are a family of four (two middle-aged adults, two school-aged boys) debating whether to take our annual family ski trip to Colorado. We would need to take a direct flight. The destination is to Frisco, Colo., where we would likely share a three-bedroom condo with my 74-year-old parents, who will be driving from Kentucky. The main activity would be skiing at Copper Mountain, which currently appears open. Should we require covid tests and wear masks in the condo until results come back? Are there precautions related to skiing we should think about? — Sara, Maryland"," We all hoped that the arrival of 2021 would mean we could leave the issues of 2020 behind us, but unfortunately that’s not how it works. Coronavirus cases and deaths are still on the rise, and vaccine distribution is off to a slow start.

Before I took your question to experts in Colorado, where you’re planning your ski trip, I wanted to see what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would advise for your situation.

Their feedback was the same as it has been for the past few months: Traveling increases your risk of being exposed or exposing someone else to the coronavirus, and postponing your trip is the best way to protect yourself and others.

“Travel itself is just one part of overall risk,” CDC spokesman Brian Katzowitz said in an email. “Taking precautions like wearing a mask, staying at least six feet from others, avoiding gatherings, and washing your hands are important ways to protect yourself from infection.”

While Colorado doesn’t have blanket coronavirus travel restrictions for out-of-state visitors, guidelines vary by county. For example, Pitkin County, home to Aspen, requires travelers sign an affidavit saying they have gotten a negative coronavirus test result within 72 hours of arrival.

In Summit County, where you’re planning on staying and skiing, no testing or affidavit is required, but visitors must wear masks in public indoor spaces and outside when they can’t stay six feet from others, and should not gather with people from other households, among other rules.

Even if it’s not required, the CDC recommends anyone traveling domestically get a viral coronavirus test one to three days before travel and three to five days after returning home.

Connie Savor Price, an infectious-disease physician and the chief medical officer at Denver Health, is also most worried about your parents traveling at this time, and she recommends postponing your trip until they have been fully vaccinated or go without them.

If you still decide to go, it would be better to have separate lodging from your parents. If that’s not possible, maintain social distance from your parents at all times, limit time indoors together, and keep your masks on inside. You may also want to eat your meals apart.

“We know that dining can be particularly risky indoors,” says Rachel Herlihy, Colorado’s state epidemiologist. “Keep in mind if individuals are removing masks at any time, that’s going to create a potential for transmission.”

“Masks and goggles are part of the normal attire, so it doesn’t even feel odd to have to do that. It’s outdoors. I think it can be done very safely,” Price says. “The biggest risk is really what you do outside of skiing: You know, getting lunch in a crowded chalet, taking off your masks, being in a crowded area.”

Your ski destination, Copper Mountain, has implemented coronavirus protocols, like mask requirements, however it still acknowledges on its website that “we cannot guarantee you will not be exposed to COVID-19 during your visit.”

Herlihy says travelers should plan for the worst-case scenario of getting infected or developing symptoms during their trip. It’s not only a health concern, but also a financial one.","It's great that you're considering safety measures for your family ski trip to Colorado. As of my last knowledge update in early 2022, COVID-19 precautions were still very much a part of travel planning.

Given the circumstances, it's advisable for your family to take COVID-19 tests before the trip, especially since you'll be sharing a condo with your elderly parents. This precaution helps ensure everyone's safety and peace of mind during the vacation. Waiting for the test results before going mask-free in close quarters is a responsible approach.

Additionally, it's wise to stay informed about any travel restrictions or requirements in both your departure and destination locations. Airlines and local health authorities may have specific guidelines.

On the skiing front, outdoor activities like skiing are generally considered lower risk. However, it's essential to follow any safety guidelines provided by the ski resort. This might include wearing masks in certain areas, practicing social distancing, and being mindful of any changes in the resort's policies.

Ultimately, prioritizing safety and staying flexible with your plans will contribute to a more enjoyable and worry-free family vacation."
WP,"I am starting to get invites for trips with friends for a month or two from now. As much as I want to travel, or at least start planning, it feels too early. Most recently, a friend asked if I want to visit our two friends in Portland, Ore. We would both be flying from two different cities on the East Coast and staying with our friends and their partners. The thought of being in an airport, sitting on a crowded flight and being in a different city right now feels irresponsible. I am really struggling with how to have conversations about not feeling comfortable with this just yet without coming off as judgmental. — Rachel, Washington, D. C.","Friends and family have been clashing over the coronavirus for about a year now, from mask-wearing to vaccines to group gatherings. I wholeheartedly relate to your situation, as my loved ones regularly remind me that I’m “all gloom and doom” and “ruining the fun” when I turn down pandemic travel suggestions.

To find the best solution for our problem, I went to Andrea Bonior, a licensed clinical psychologist who has an advice column “Ask Dr. Andrea” on The Lily. On a phone call this week, she told me these situations may be easier to approach now that we’ve been knee-deep in the pandemic for so long.

“In the beginning, a lot of these things felt very awkward to talk about. ... Everything was new. People were changing their minds,” Bonior said. “I do think people have gotten a little bit more secure in finding ways to communicate that are respectful, and a little bit more secure in their views.”

Before you answer your friend, Bonior said to determine the risks you’re willing to take, the ones you’re not and why. Ask yourself: How much of your own mental and physical well-being are you willing to sacrifice for a trip?

Maybe you are comfortable taking some risks locally, like going to your gym where you know their safety protocols, but you’re not comfortable flying across the country.

“Having that rationale can help you — not that you have to defend your choices,” Bonior says. “But actually mentally to yourself, it’s a little bit easier to bolster your argument and use when you’re thinking about boundaries.”

Of course, the pandemic is ever-changing, and you are allowed to change your mind. Your line in the sand may change as new information comes out about the coronavirus, if you get vaccinated or for a number of other reasons.

Once you feel confident in your stance, reply to your friend honestly. That means don’t say “yes” or “maybe” to a trip if you know you are going to back out later. Bonior said a lot of people think it will be easier to avoid conflict, but it actually can damage your relationship by eroding trust.

“If you develop a pattern of doing that, then everybody knows that you’re going to be the one who backs out later,” Bonior said.

Opt out as clearly and respectfully as possible so your friend doesn’t get their hopes up or get a mixed signal that if they wear on you long enough, you will eventually give in.

Traditionally thought of as a technique reserved for couples to resolve conflict, using “I” statements can be helpful to handle issues with platonic loved ones. Framing your decision from your point of view will help you avoid sounding judgmental.

“I think the more deep the relationship, the more it can sustain these nuanced, difficult conversations where you might say, ‘I really feel guilty not being there, but I know what’s best for me’ or ‘I really have mixed feelings and I might regret this later, but I have to say no,’"" Bonior said.

Should the conversation get heated, remember that travel shaming doesn’t work. If you expect a friend or loved one to respond to your declined invitation aggressively, have a script ready with those “I” statements in advance.

“If they try to take you off script, have that one thing that you keep returning to, like ‘I love you and I wish I could, but I can’t. I’m sorry,’” Bonior said.

“You can have a respectful conversation, ‘Hey, I totally get that you’re trying to do this. I would feel remiss if I didn’t just mention I’m worried about you doing this, and I will shut up, but I got to get this off my chest,’” Bonior said. “That’s different than shaming ... but once your friend has made a decision, then the shaming part is just going to create some sort of a rift.”","Navigating the delicate balance between personal comfort and social expectations can be challenging, especially when it comes to travel during these uncertain times. It's completely valid to prioritize your health and safety concerns. To convey your reservations without sounding judgmental, consider expressing your feelings in a way that emphasizes your personal perspective.

You might say something like, ""I truly appreciate the invitation and am eager to see everyone, but given the current circumstances, I'm a bit apprehensive about travel right now. I hope you understand it's more about my own comfort level than any judgment towards your plans.""

By framing it as a matter of personal comfort rather than passing judgment on others' choices, you open the door for understanding and empathy. Additionally, you can suggest alternative ways to stay connected, such as virtual meet-ups or planning for a future trip when the situation feels more settled.

Remember, communication is key, and expressing your concerns openly and respectfully is the foundation for fostering understanding among friends. Stay true to your boundaries, and genuine friends will appreciate and respect your perspective.

Safe travels, wherever they may lead."
WP," Last winter my wife (57) and I (51) booked a June trip to Prague and Germany for our belated honeymoon. Of course, we all know what happened. Luckily, we were able to cancel without any penalties. We would like to try again for a 10-day trip this summer, but we just don’t know if it will be possible or practical yet. We had planned to fly into Prague to visit with a friend of ours, and see the sights before leaving for Germany. We hadn’t nailed down that part of the trip yet, but we had a few general ideas of things we wanted to do and see, using a combination of Airbnb and hotels. What do you think? — Rob, Bellevue, Neb.
","I took your question to a few different experts: travel advisers whose job it is to plan honeymoons like yours during this uncertain time, and public health experts who could weigh in more generally on the trajectory of the pandemic.

Eric Feigl-Ding, an epidemiologist and senior fellow with the Federation of American Scientists, says the current European Union vaccine drama makes it impossible to predict the outlook for summer travel.

“There is so much uncertainty right now with the vaccine delivery time schedule,” he says. “We don’t know how many vaccines are going to be delivered and administered; all of the timetables that we previously had were counting on the AstraZeneca [vaccine roll out].""

Virologist Benhur Lee, who is a microbiology professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, says it’s also difficult to give you a blanket answer as each country in Europe will be on different reopening timelines. Because some governments will do better than others, Lee suggests you pay attention to the news coming out of Prague and Germany specifically.

And even if you’re fully vaccinated by this summer, there is no guarantee that Germany and Prague would have fully relaxed their coronavirus restrictions, according to Lee. They could reopen, but who knows if they’ll need to keep partial lockdowns, mask requirements, etc.

On a positive note, Lee says there’s a general sense that as additional vaccines get approved, manufacturing capacity ramps up and a larger percentage of people are vaccinated, we could see some semblance of normalcy by late summer. With that in mind, August or September may be a more viable timeline for your honeymoon.

It’s not in a travel adviser’s best interest to book you on a vacation you can’t take, so I spoke with Shelby Donley, the vice president of luxury services for travel management company Direct Travel, to see how she’d handle your trip planning.

At this time, Donley says many of her clients are taking a wait-and-see approach to their 2021 travel plans, vs. booking now and hoping for the best. Should summer be rapidly approaching and Prague and Germany seem impossible, Donley would figure out another suitable and viable honeymoon destination based on your interests.

If you do decide to go ahead with your honeymoon later this year, Estee Gubbay, a travel adviser at Protravel International, recommends carefully reviewing the deposit and cancellation policies when booking any travel, and purchasing comprehensive, pandemic-specific travel insurance.

And as you make your decision, it doesn’t hurt to get your travel documents in order just in case. The pandemic has caused delays in getting passports processed, so if you and your wife are due for a renewal, now’s a good time to get those sorted.","Congratulations on your belated honeymoon! It's unfortunate that your plans for last summer had to be canceled, but it's great that you were able to do so without any penalties. As for your upcoming trip, predicting the state of travel in the summer can be a bit tricky given the uncertainties surrounding the global situation.

The best course of action would be to keep a close eye on travel advisories and restrictions for the destinations you plan to visit. Check the current COVID-19 situation in Prague and Germany, and monitor any updates from health authorities. Flexibility will be key in your planning—consider booking refundable accommodations and flights to accommodate any unforeseen changes.

Additionally, have a backup plan or two in case your original itinerary faces challenges. It might be worth consulting with your friend in Prague about the local situation and getting insights into the feasibility of your visit.

Stay optimistic, stay informed, and be ready to adapt your plans based on the evolving circumstances. Here's hoping that this summer brings you the honeymoon adventure you've been waiting for."
WP,"“My partner, her sister and I are planning to drive from Massachusetts to Sacramento to spend the winter (6-8 weeks) with their mother (she’s in her 50s). They both get tested for covid-19 at least once a week by their graduate programs, and we’ll be taking all the proper precautions during the five-day drive, but we’re still concerned that we’re being irresponsible.” — Jacob","Your plan is definitely on brand for 2020 — more people opted for the Great American Road Trip this year when traveling. While air travel has dropped significantly since March, AAA estimated that car trips have only dipped slightly. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is urging everyone to reconsider winter travel to slow the spread of the coronavirus — whether you are going by car, plane, train or bus.

“I really wouldn’t travel right now,” she says. “My concern is that we’re at the beginning of the [coronavirus case] increases from Thanksgiving travel, and we’re already at a point where health-care systems are overwhelmed.”

Bhadelia warns that we are about to suffer a one-two punch from people gathering for Thanksgiving and Christmas, and that we’ll be living with the consequences come January.

The next thing to consider is that California has implemented strict regional lockdowns, which includes the greater Sacramento area. The state health department issued a travel advisory last month requiring nonessential travelers to self-quarantine for 14 days. But because of the recent stay-at-home-order, you will not be able to stay at a hotel to quarantine properly away from your partner’s mom unless your trip is deemed essential travel.

But if you still end up taking the trip, there are concerns to address before, during and after your cross-country drive. Bhadelia says it is good that your travel companions (and hopefully you as well) are getting tested, but a negative test result doesn’t mean much if you’re not doing other things to reduce potential exposure to the virus.

The safest way to travel together is to quarantine before the trip. If you live separately, you should be quarantining separately, Bhadelia says.

“Decreasing your chances of being exposed right before travel is one way that you could mitigate some of that risk,” she says.

Once you get in the car with your partner and her sister, Bhadelia recommends keeping the windows open and wearing masks throughout the trip. Remember to pack extra personal protective equipment, hand sanitizer and sanitizing wipes for the journey.

Other challenges will come as you drive. You will have to check every state’s rules and restrictions where you plan to stop.

Along the way, Bhadelia is most concerned about reducing your interactions with strangers. Limit your stops and time spent around other people (particularly if you’re indoors) as much as you can. Make gas station stops quick, order food to-go (or better yet, pack food), and keep your masks on whenever you’re around others.

If you are stopping at hotels or motels, Bhadelia recommends opening the room’s windows and letting it ventilate. As someone who stayed at a few hotels recently, I can tell you that coronavirus precautions will vary from place to place, so check in with caution.

“The thing that raises the risk highest right now is that the community transmission is so high [right now] that you will encounter somebody who has an infection either before you leave, during your travel or when you’re over there,” she says. ""[The risks] are much higher than they were in the summer.”

You can tell family you’ll see them sooner than later. Bhadelia feels optimistic about our ability to travel safely to see loved ones in the near future now that the vaccines will begin to roll out soon.

“We just have to hang in there a bit longer,” she says. “The vaccines are about to be distributed, it may be a few months until the general public gets it.”","Your concerns about responsible travel during the ongoing pandemic are valid, and it's great that you're taking steps to mitigate risks. First and foremost, ensuring everyone in the car is regularly tested is a responsible approach, especially considering the testing frequency due to their graduate programs.

For the road trip itself, make sure to adhere to safety guidelines: wear masks, practice good hand hygiene, and maintain social distancing when possible. Plan your route carefully, taking into account areas with lower infection rates and avoiding high-risk areas.

While there's no way to eliminate all risks, being mindful of your actions is crucial. Consider limiting stops to essential breaks, choose accommodations that follow proper hygiene protocols, and pack essentials to minimize unnecessary stops.

It's also wise to check the COVID-19 guidelines and restrictions along your route, as they can vary. Stay informed about the situation at your destination, and be prepared to adapt your plans if needed.

Communication is key—discuss your concerns openly with your partner and her sister. Ensure everyone is on the same page about precautions and expectations.

Ultimately, with careful planning, open communication, and strict adherence to safety measures, you can strive to make your winter visit as responsible and safe as possible. Safe travels!

WP,"“My husband and I used Expedia to book our honeymoon/first anniversary trip for Greece in May 2020. At the time, Expedia would not offer us refunds on the local hotels we had reserved (with nonrefundable bookings). Instead, they gave us gift certificates that we could use within one year’s time. Well, we’ve reached one year later, and we still don’t seem much closer to making it to Greece. Is there a way that Expedia can just give us our money back? Thank you.” — Renuka Lakshmanan, Maryland
","In the past year, I’ve gotten dozens of emails from readers trying to get thousands of dollars back from canceled travel. The Department of Transportation received such high volumes of complaints about airlines withholding refunds in 2020 that they had to issue an enforcement notice that U.S. and foreign airlines must give cash refunds if a flight to, within or from the United States is canceled or has a significant schedule change.

I reached out to Expedia Group about your case, and I was told the company has been pushing its hotel partners to extend hotel vouchers to the end of 2021 and hope your issue may be easy to fix.

Van Cleef says you and other travelers seeking refunds for plans canceled by the coronavirus should be prepared to be persistent following up on that. You may have to fight for days, weeks or months to get your desired result.

“Never accept the first offer unless the first offer is all of your money back,” van Cleef says, explaining that travel companies have been trying to offer customers vouchers that may not be as valuable as their initial booking. “They will try to nickel and dime you,” he says.

If you’re not getting anywhere with the company, van Cleef says to file a complaint with an organization such as PIRG that looks out for consumers, or get in touch with a lawyer (if that won’t be a major expense to you). As with flights, you may be able to get help from your credit card company to resolve hotel refund disputes.

But in the event that you feel comfortable traveling and would like to use those gift certificates to actually get to Greece, I took your situation to Eduardo Santander, executive director of the European Travel Commission, an association that represents the European Union’s national tourism organizations.

Between the continent’s vaccination rollout and its “digital green certificates” plan aimed at salvaging the summer tourism season, Santander says those in the tourism industry are feeling very optimistic about the return of international visitors.

At this time, Greece has a plan to reopen on May 14 to visitors who have been vaccinated, have antibodies or test negative for the coronavirus. Because Greece’s economy depends heavily on tourism, Santander believes that plan carries weight.

However, Santander would not bet on a May honeymoon or book airfare just yet. Rather, consider rebooking for the late summer or early fall, as long as you may be able to change the dates again — Santander recognizes that new variants could go rogue and disrupt the pandemic recovery’s upward trajectory. At this time, Europe is facing a new surge of coronavirus cases that has put several countries under lockdown and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still recommends avoiding nonessential travel, even for the vaccinated, as the jury is still out on whether vaccinated travelers can pass the virus to others.

Even if you’re vaccinated and feeling protected, Santander says, visitors will have to stay vigilant with coronavirus precautions. “If there are restrictions, follow them. It’s not only for yourself, but for everybody — the travel community and your hosts,” he says.","I understand the frustration you and your husband must be feeling after the challenges of the past year. Navigating travel disruptions during the pandemic has been a common concern for many. In your case, the situation with Expedia's gift certificates presents a tricky scenario.

While Expedia's initial approach of providing gift certificates might have seemed like a practical solution amid unprecedented uncertainties, it's essential to review the terms and conditions associated with these vouchers. Some certificates do offer flexibility in terms of extensions or alternative arrangements.

However, if you find that you are still unable to utilize the certificates and would prefer a refund, I recommend reaching out to Expedia's customer service directly. Explain your situation, emphasizing the continued restrictions and challenges preventing your travel plans. Given the exceptional circumstances surrounding global travel during the pandemic, they might be able to offer a more flexible resolution, such as an extension or, ideally, a refund.

Remember to remain patient and persistent in your communication with Expedia, highlighting the impact the ongoing situation has had on your plans. In uncertain times like these, many companies are willing to work with customers to find fair and reasonable solutions.

Wishing you and your husband the best for your future travel plans, whenever they may come to fruition."
WP,"“Airbnb host refused to refund me even though Airbnb has asked multiple times. Am I entitled to a refund? I have met all the Extenuating Circumstances besides canceling the reservation myself.” — Melissa K., Lynnfield, Mass.
","Unfortunately, I get emails about travel refunds on a weekly basis. Even now that “the year of canceled plans” is officially over and the country is getting back to normal, many people are still chasing down money spent on flights never taken, hotel rooms never slept in, etc. Someone recently wrote in to lament over $20,000 lost on a cruise trip she couldn’t take.

I would like to give you better news, but you may be out of luck. I reached out to Airbnb, and a spokesperson pointed me to Airbnb’s COVID-19 Extenuating Circumstances policy, which says: “Cancellations will be handled according to the extenuating circumstances coverage in effect at the time of submission, and reservations that were already canceled will not be reconsidered.”

That last part is important. Sometimes people are eligible for a refund under that Extenuating Circumstances policy, but if they cancel at the wrong time — i.e. too early or too late — they lose that eligibility.

At that point, you’re at the mercy of the host. It’s not impossible to get an Airbnb host to give you a refund, but it could be an uphill battle.

“There have definitely been some issues over the last year and change — chiefly because you’re at the whim of the owner,” Kyle Potter, editor of the Thrifty Traveler, told me. “Airbnb has expanded its policies, some for ‘extenuating circumstances’ in the last year, but it seems that’s clearly not enough to help out travelers when owners don’t play nice.”

Even though your situation may be different from this reader’s refund woes that we examined last year, the advice from experts remains the same: try to negotiate with the host. Are they willing to grant you an exception and give you a refund? Plead your case, and hope that their empathy kicks in.

In the case that your host agrees to a full or partial refund — and is actually willing to go through with it — then you can contact Customer Support, which will process your refund.

These refund problems aren’t going to go away once the pandemic is fully over. As we resume travel, we’re bound to have a few hiccups misinterpreting the fine print, booking the wrong dates and finding better rates moments after locking in something else. Do your best to pick refundable or flexible travel opportunities to avoid getting burned again.","I'm sorry to hear about the challenges you're facing with your Airbnb reservation. In situations like these, it's important to understand the terms of Airbnb's Extenuating Circumstances policy. While I can't provide legal advice, I can offer some general guidance.

Typically, the Extenuating Circumstances policy allows for refunds in unforeseen situations, such as natural disasters or unexpected travel restrictions. If you've met all the specified criteria and Airbnb has intervened on your behalf without success, you might consider documenting the communication with Airbnb, including any requests they've made to the host.

To strengthen your case, gather evidence of the extenuating circumstances that prevented you from using the reservation, ensuring you have a clear timeline of events. It may be beneficial to reach out to Airbnb again, providing them with the comprehensive documentation.

If your efforts through Airbnb prove unsuccessful, you may want to explore your options with your credit card company, as some offer chargeback services for situations like this. Additionally, local consumer protection agencies or small claims court may be avenues worth considering, depending on the specific circumstances and applicable laws in your jurisdiction.

Remember, it's crucial to consult with a legal professional for advice tailored to your situation. I hope you find a resolution to your Airbnb concerns soon.

WP,"“At the end of the summer, I booked a house on Airbnb in Durham, N. C., where my children and I could celebrate Christmas together. We have not seen each other since last winter. I am 72 and have asthma; they live too far to make the drive without stopping. Now they have decided it’s too dangerous to me for us to gather. I have paid more than $1,500 for the Airbnb, and the cutoff date for even a partial refund was this month. After looking forward to this holiday, my spirits are flagging, and I am concerned about the money. What is your advice for getting a refund? — Mary, North Carolina
","I felt the same way you did at the end of the summer (and traveled to see my family as a result); lockdowns lifted, restaurants offered indoor dining, it seemed like the worst of the pandemic was over.

Now we’re facing the darkest days of the coronavirus crisis, so your family made the right call. Health experts are begging people not to travel for the holidays, warning that the United States is about to suffer greatly from people gathering for Thanksgiving and Christmas.

Unfortunately, getting a refund for your Airbnb booking can be tricky and not a guarantee, even with the new surge of cases.

First, I took your question to Airbnb to get their thoughts on your situation. They pointed me to their Help Center Extenuating Circumstances Policy page. Because you made the reservation in the summer, you can’t easily cancel the reservation for a refund, despite the coronavirus surge.

At the beginning of the pandemic, Airbnb adjusted its policies so guests and hosts could cancel stays and Airbnb Experiences made on or before March 14 without penalties.

Normal host cancellation policies went back into effect for reservations made after March 14, a few days after the World Health Organization declared the crisis a global pandemic “and its consequences were no longer unexpected, including the risk of continued or new travel and movement restrictions,” the website says.

According to Airbnb, the majority of its listings have “flexible or moderate cancellation policies, both of which allow for full refunds of the nightly rate for cancellations made at least 5 days prior to check-in, regardless of the circumstances” but if that doesn’t apply to your case, the Airbnb spokesperson said the company encourages guests in your situation to contact the host.

Your best bet is to explain your circumstance to the host and ask if they would be willing to offer you an exception to their cancellation policy. If the host agrees, you can contact Customer Support, which will process your refund.

Richard Fertig, founder of Short Term Rental University, agrees with Airbnb’s advice, but he warns it’s unlikely you’ll get all of your money back. Because you’re dealing with a human and not a robot, Fertig recommends appealing to them with your health concerns and hoping they will be empathetic to your case.

“I would suggest for her to try to work through this in an amicable way,” says Fertig, who has been a host on Airbnb since 2014. “Most hosts are compassionate and caring and so on. You have to understand what the host point of view is, then work towards a resolution.”

Although Airbnb did distribute $17 million in grants to accommodate hosts, the pandemic has been a trying time for many hosts. Fertig says some hosts may be struggling financially and less inclined to agree to a full refund. You can try negotiating a partial refund, or ask for a booking credit instead of a cancellation and reschedule your family visit for another time.

It turns out this advice isn’t just applicable for Airbnb. Fertig says while there are differences on each short-term-rental platform, cancellation policies are pretty comparable. I checked in with a representative at Vrbo about a similar reader question, and I found it also suggests travelers connect with the property owner and see if they would be willing to work with them for a credit or future stay — although it’s ultimately up to the host.

Finally, if you’re not having luck with your Airbnb host, Sean Harper, co-founder and chief executive officer of Kin Insurance, says you may be able to turn to your credit card company to help. Or you can dispute the charges.","I'm sorry to hear about the challenges you're facing, both in terms of health concerns and the disappointment of canceled plans. In situations like this, empathy often goes a long way. Start by reaching out to Airbnb's customer support. Explain your circumstances, emphasizing the health risks involved due to your asthma and the unexpected change in your children's plans. Provide any supporting documentation, such as a doctor's note or other medical records, to strengthen your case.

In addition to contacting Airbnb, consider reaching out directly to the host. Explain the situation, expressing your understanding of the challenges hosts face and your hope for an amicable resolution. Some hosts may be willing to work with you, offering a partial refund or a credit for a future stay.

Remember to be persistent but polite in your communication. If you encounter resistance, escalate the matter by referring to Airbnb's extenuating circumstances policy or any relevant terms in your booking agreement.

While there's no guarantee of a full refund, a compassionate and transparent approach could increase the likelihood of a positive resolution.

Wishing you good health and a swift resolution to your concerns."
WP,"“What are the chances that we will be able to take a Caribbean cruise out of Florida in August? Any clue when the CDC will give cruise lines the okay?” — Susan Iwamoto, San Jose, Calif.","The good news for cruise fans is that if you would like to sail through the Caribbean this summer, you have some options. Whether you can start your voyage in Florida is another story, however.

As you mentioned, the cruise industry is still waiting for permission from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to resume operations from U. S. ports since the no-sail order was issued on March 14, 2020.

According to David Crooks, senior vice president of product and operations for World Travel Holdings, a major U. S. cruise agency and travel company, that legal action has helped bring awareness to the issue, and could help push the CDC to act soon.

“Our goal is to have cruising resume this summer from U. S. ports,” Salerno says. “We’re in active discussions with the CDC to look at what can be done to make cruising possible.”

While the CDC has said it is safe for fully vaccinated people to travel, it is still not recommending people do so while coronavirus cases remain high and variants continue to be a threat. With that in mind, know that your cruise plan won’t be foolproof even if the CDC lifts its conditional sailing order.

“Cruising is continuously in a state of flux,” says Colleen McDaniel, editor in chief of Cruise Critic. “The story changes from one day to the next — it’s really based on what’s happening with the pandemic.”

Should the CDC continue to ban U. S. cruising, you have other options to take a Caribbean cruise vacation this summer, but you would have to go abroad to start. Major cruise lines have positioned ships to operate from Caribbean ports, as well as other international places such as Europe, where sailing is currently allowed.

No matter where you’re embarking from, there will be new layers of coronavirus precautions at play throughout your trip. You will probably have to provide a negative coronavirus test before you board, and you may be required to be vaccinated depending on the cruise line.

“There’s going to be requirements for public health and sanitation that are very different from when people remember cruising before the pandemic,” Salerno says. “All of the types of precautions that people are used to taking on shore, such as masks and social distancing and so forth, you’ll see that reflected on board ships.”

Karen Edwards, professor and chair of the department of epidemiology at University of California at Irvine, says following those precautions is recommended for vaccinated and unvaccinated cruise travelers alike, though Edwards does not recommend someone take a cruise unless they have been fully immunized.

“I would certainly keep up the good hygiene habits of hand washing, and I would wear my mask,” Edwards says. “I would just act as if I weren’t vaccinated, but at least feel a little more confident I’m protected against covid.”

McDaniel says those interested in cruises should invest in travel insurance that covers pandemic concerns and book a voyage that allows passengers to cancel or reschedule without penalty. She also encourages people to enlist the help of a travel adviser to help navigate new complications, including the inbound testing requirement to return to the United States if you’re traveling abroad.

If you’re looking to sail this summer, or later in 2021, you may want to book as soon as possible. With many ships operating at a reduced capacity, and fewer ships currently cruising, supply may not support the record-breaking demand the industry is already seeing.","Ahoy, Susan! Your cruise enthusiasm is contagious, and I totally get the excitement of setting sail in the Caribbean. Now, predicting the future—especially in the world of pandemic protocols—is a tricky task. As of my last update in early 2022, the CDC had provided a phased approach to resume cruise operations, emphasizing a gradual return to normalcy with rigorous health and safety measures.

The timeline, however, is a moving target. Cruise lines are working closely with health authorities to meet the necessary criteria for a safe voyage. August might be a bit of a stretch, but optimism is the wind in our sails. Keep a close eye on CDC announcements, as they'll be the compass guiding these decisions.

Factors like vaccination rates, virus trends, and international regulations play a pivotal role. If the stars align, and the pandemic is tamed further, there's a good chance cruise lines will set sail from Florida. My advice? Stay tuned to official updates, follow the guidelines, and have a plan B just in case the waters get a bit choppy.

Happy cruising, and here's hoping those Caribbean waves welcome you in August!"
WP,"Some spices we use frequently and do replace them frequently, others we use far less frequently so they sit on the shelf for a while. How do we judge when a particular spice has passed its shelf life?","Here’s what you should consider when trying to decide if your spices should stay or go.

Spices don’t really go bad, but they do become less potent over time. Whole spices, such as cinnamon sticks and peppercorns, can retain their flavor for years. For ground spices, such as cumin and coriander, it’s generally recommended to replace them every 6 months or so for maximum flavor. (Dried herbs in particular don’t stay flavorful for very long.)

An easy way to check potency is to just open up your spices and give them a whiff. If they smell nice and potent, then you’re good to go. If they don’t smell much like anything, then they are past their prime and should probably be replaced.

But if you don’t want to buy new spices that frequently, you can simply use more than a recipe calls for of less potent jars to help compensate for the diminished flavor. (Don’t forget to taste your food as you’re cooking!)

Most importantly, make sure you are storing your spices properly. Spices should be kept in an airtight container away from sunlight and heat — to keep them fresh for as long as possible.","
Hey there! It's a great question, especially given how important spices are in adding flavor to our dishes. The good news is that spices don't exactly spoil like perishable foods, but they do lose their potency over time. A good rule of thumb is to consider the color, aroma, and taste.

If your spice has faded in color or lost its vibrant hue, it might be on the decline. Aroma is another key indicator. Give it a whiff—if the scent is weak or almost non-existent, it's time to think about a replacement. Lastly, trust your taste buds. If the spice isn't delivering the punch it used to, it's likely past its prime.

Storage conditions also play a role. Keep your spices away from heat, moisture, and direct sunlight. Opt for a cool, dark spot, and consider storing them in airtight containers to preserve their flavor.

While there's no strict expiration date for most spices, ground spices typically last around 2-3 years, while whole spices can last 3-4 years. When in doubt, do a sensory check, and if your spices aren't tickling your taste buds, it might be time to bid them farewell and welcome a fresh batch to the spice party!"
WP,"I love fish and seafood, and I’m pretty good at cooking fish on the stove or in the oven. But I seem to overcook shrimp and scallops, so I’ve been avoiding them. Is there a way to know when they are done? Maybe a thermometer reading?","Here’s how to tell when your shrimp and scallops are perfectly cooked. For shrimp, you need to cook them just until they turn pink. However, this happens very quickly. Even for larger shrimp, and depending on the heat of the skillet, you only need a minute or two per side. The key to keeping shrimp from overcooking is to keep a watchful eye and move quickly to get them in and out of the pan. A live chat reader added: “My problem with cooking shrimp is that some in the pan will be completely done while others still have large gray areas. My solution is to pick out the done ones and put them aside, but do you have any better suggestions?” That is indeed the best solution: Remove the cooked shrimp from the pan as soon as they are done while the rest finish cooking. For scallops, finding the freshest, untreated, dry-packed scallops is the key to a great cook. (Similarly, you should look for shrimp that hasn’t been treated with chemicals.) While you can use a thermometer — the FDA recommends cooking most seafood to an internal temperature of 145 degrees — it would be time-consuming and cumbersome to measure the temperature of each scallop. And like shrimp, they also cook quickly. Sight and touch are much better indicators for doneness. Scallops are cooked when they are firm, nicely browned and opaque all the way through. If the reason you end up overcooking scallops is because you’re waiting for them to get nicely browned, make sure to pat the scallops dry, do not overcrowd the pan, and cook them for only 2 to 3 minutes per side over high heat. Some people mostly just cook scallops on one side until nicely browned to keep from overcooking them, which is especially useful for smaller scallops. And again, remove each scallop from the pan when it is done to your liking.","Absolutely! Cooking shrimp and scallops perfectly can be a bit tricky, but fear not, I've got some tips to help you nail it every time. Unlike meat, seafood doesn't need a thermometer to determine its doneness. It's all about visual and textural cues.

For shrimp, they typically turn pink and opaque when they're done. Keep an eye on the color transformation—overcooked shrimp tend to become tough and rubbery. Cooking time can vary depending on the size of the shrimp, but generally, it takes around 2-3 minutes per side in a hot pan.

Scallops, on the other hand, should have a golden-brown crust on the outside while remaining tender inside. They usually take about 1.5 to 2.5 minutes per side in a hot pan. The key is a hot pan and not overcrowding, allowing each piece to sear properly.

To avoid overcooking, have everything prepared and ready to go before you start cooking. Overcooking can happen in the blink of an eye, especially with seafood. Remember, practice makes perfect, so don't be afraid to experiment and adjust your cooking times based on your preferences. Happy cooking!"
WP,"I made a Washington Post recipe for Carrot Bread. The flavor is excellent, but the center 2 inches was completely unbaked, even after 90 minutes in the oven (baking time was supposed to be 1 hour). My loaf pan was slightly larger than called for, but the batter filled it to about half an inch from the top. I suspect I used too much carrot.
","Problems with quick breads that are raw in the center or dipped, rather than domed, in the middle are pretty common.

Sometimes things do just need longer to bake for … whatever reason. As with any other kind of bake, the best first step to take is to weigh your ingredients. Too much or too little flour, for example, can throw off the balance.

Also important: The type of pan you use. Metal pans are by far the better choice for cakes and bars than glass. Glass is an insulator rather than a conductor and is slower to heat (and then slower to cool down), which can cause problems.

Metal is a much more efficient conductor, with some types of pans preferable to others. Heavy-gauge aluminum “transfers heat quickly and doesn’t warp or have hot spots like less expensive thin-gauge pans,” according to “The Science of Good Food.”

“Cakes should definitely go in metal,” pastry chef and cookbook author Joanne Chang told me. The slower transfer of heat to the batter means cakes baked in glass (or ceramic) will take longer than those in metal (five to eight minutes, according to a test done by Cook’s Illustrated).

So why not just leave a glass pan in the oven longer? The longer a cake, or even a batch of brownies or blondies, bakes, the more likely the edges will be overcooked — and disproportionately higher up the pan — by the time the center is done. They may continue to dry out as the pan cools, too, because of the heat retention.

How did things turn out for this reader? Glass was, in fact, the culprit. As they reported back, “I tried again using an aluminum loaf pan. I’m very happy to report that it came out perfectly. Thank you for helping to troubleshoot — and the excuse to make the carrot bread again (and again!).”","I appreciate your enthusiasm for trying out our recipes, and I'm sorry to hear about the hiccup with your Carrot Bread. Baking can indeed be a delicate dance, and small adjustments can sometimes lead to unexpected results. In this case, the larger pan might have played a role in the center not fully baking.

Using a larger pan means the batter spreads out more thinly, which can affect the cooking time and result in an unevenly baked loaf. To address this issue, try reducing the baking time and keeping a close eye on the bread. I'd recommend checking for doneness by inserting a toothpick into the center—when it comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs, your bread should be ready.

Additionally, since you suspect an excess of carrots, make sure to follow the recipe's measurements precisely. Too much moisture from the carrots could contribute to uneven baking. If you decide to use a larger pan again, consider adjusting the ingredient quantities accordingly to maintain the right balance.

Experimenting in the kitchen is all part of the fun, and I hope these tips help you achieve a perfectly baked Carrot Bread next time. Happy baking!

WP,I have never frozen soup but would like to. Any advice or guidelines?T,"The reader who sent it is a person after my own heart, as I think there are few things more comforting than knowing there is a ready-made meal just waiting for you to pull out whenever you need it. Thankfully, soup is one of those things that freezes very well across the board. Here are some tips to keep in mind.

Store soup in shallow containers when freezing. This will make freezing and thawing more efficient. Individual portions are great. Also remember to leave some head space to allow for expansion during freezing.

Think ahead when you want to thaw frozen soup. Pop the container in the fridge the night before or the morning of the day when you want to eat it so it can defrost.

Use the microwave and stovetop on short notice. This is a handy strategy. You can use the microwave to loosen the food from the container (try a reduced heat level or use the defrost function) before transferring over to a pot to finish heating all the way through. You can also run your container briefly under warm tap water just enough to loosen it from the sides before heating on the stovetop. The government recommends bringing soups back to a rolling boil to ensure safety.

Be prepared to make some adjustments. Some vegetables or other ingredients may break down or come out softer after frozen soup thaws, but I don’t consider it a dealbreaker. A fellow chatter chimed in: “Pasta in soup tends to get mushy when the soup is frozen, then reheated. So if that matters to you … cook pasta separately each time you serve the rest of the soup. Ditto for diced potatoes, to a lesser extent.” If your creamy soup separates after it thaws, simply whisk it while heating or use an immersion or stick blender to bring it back together.

Keep track of what meals you have stored. For the best quality, use frozen soups and stews within two to three months. Label and date containers, and regularly look at what you have in the freezer. If you’re really organized, you can document the inventory on a whiteboard on the fridge.","Absolutely, freezing soup can be a game-changer for convenient and delicious meals. Here are some guidelines to ensure your frozen soup maintains its flavor and texture:

1. **Cool it down:** Before freezing, allow the soup to cool to room temperature. Placing hot soup in the freezer can raise the temperature inside and affect other frozen items.

2. **Portion control:** Consider freezing individual portions in airtight containers or freezer bags. This makes it easier to thaw only what you need and reduces waste.

3. **Leave room for expansion:** Liquids expand when frozen, so be sure to leave some space at the top of the container to avoid spills or breakage.

4. **Labeling:** Always label your containers with the date and type of soup. This helps you keep track of how long it's been in the freezer and ensures you use the oldest batches first.

5. **Freeze in flat layers:** If possible, lay the containers flat in the freezer until they are solid. This allows for quicker and more even thawing.

6. **Choose freezer-friendly ingredients:** Some ingredients may not freeze well, like pasta or dairy-based soups. Consider adding these elements after thawing and reheating.

7. **Thawing and reheating:** Thaw soup in the refrigerator or using the defrost setting on your microwave. Reheat it on the stove over medium heat, stirring occasionally to maintain consistency.

By following these steps, you'll have a freezer stocked with hearty soups ready to go whenever you need a quick and comforting meal. Enjoy your freezing adventure!"
WP,"How do I get roasted veggies to be crisp? I typically use olive oil, salt and pepper, space them out on a pan and roast at 425 degrees, but they come out soggy and rarely with any browned crispy parts. I","I think this reader is off to a good start. Here are a few other suggestions.

Make sure the vegetables are as dry as possible before you roast. Pat them dry with a towel and let them continue to dry on the towel while the oven preheats.

Preheat the baking sheet. Set it on the rack while the oven heats up. When it’s time to roast, carefully add the vegetables, already tossed with oil, salt and pepper, to the pan (you’ll hear them sizzle right away) and slide it right back in. If you have a pizza stone or steel, place the baking sheet on it.

Make sure your oven is actually hot! Confirm it’s getting to the right temperature by using a stand-alone oven thermometer. If you know your oven runs a consistent number of degrees off, adjust the dial accordingly. (Or look into recalibrating it yourself or with an appliance repair person.) And as we’ve discussed before, your oven may signal that it’s preheated when it’s not. If yours is anything like mine, it could take up to 30 minutes to reach the right temperature, especially the higher you go. If you don’t want to wait until the oven is fully heated, be prepared to cook the vegetables longer.

Reconsider your rack position. Where is the heating element? The default middle rack may not actually be the best spot. Moving the pan closer to one of the elements can help. I find that I get lots more crispy edges when I roast vegetables on a rack in the upper third of the oven.

Use the convection feature on your oven, if you have one. The fan helps better circulate hot air. Or try the air fryer!","Achieving that perfect crispy texture with roasted veggies is an art, and it sounds like you're on the right track. Let's fine-tune the process a bit.

Firstly, make sure your veggies are thoroughly dry before tossing them in olive oil. Excess moisture can lead to steaming rather than roasting. Pat them with a paper towel or let them air dry for a bit before coating them.

Next, give your veggies some space on the pan. Overcrowding can trap steam and hinder browning. It's better to use a larger pan or two if needed, ensuring each piece has its own personal space to get that crispy edge.

Consider upping the oven temperature to around 450 degrees Fahrenheit. This higher heat will help with browning and caramelization, contributing to that desired crispiness.

Additionally, give your veggies a good toss halfway through the roasting time. This ensures even cooking and browning on all sides.

Experiment with the timing as well. Roast until they are golden brown but not overly shriveled. Depending on the vegetable, this might mean adjusting your cooking time slightly.

Keep these tips in mind, and you'll be well on your way to enjoying perfectly crisp roasted veggies. Happy roasting!"
WP," Eight months ago, I ran into an old flame. We had a three-year relationship that ended 10 years ago. We did not stay in touch after our breakup, and we both moved on with other people for longer relationships. We each broke up with our partners in 2022 and reconnected afterward. We have been seeing each other regularly and talking or texting every day since then. It has been great! We have both matured. Our relationship is easygoing, fun and mutually respectful.

The first time, I knew he was upset, but without warning he did not contact me for five days. I was upset and annoyed by this. I asked him to be better at communicating with me when he feels this way.

We have been communicating in a healthy way since restarting our relationship. Last week he received bad news about his job and became very stressed. He verbalized a need for space, which I understand and respect. I stated that I would like him to check in once a day with me.

He has checked in, in a very sweet way, but it is only a few texts each day! He is not updating me on how he feels or asking me how I am doing during these brief exchanges. I do want him to have space, but after a week of this, I definitely want to return to normal communication.

Should I say something to him, or should I give this more time, since he is doing what I asked him to do? How long is too long?","

Impatient: Your guy is following your instructions, which tells you that he has some awareness of your needs and that he wants to please you. And while you asked him to check in “once a day,” he is checking in several times a day, and yet — his texts don’t contain the wording or content you would prefer.

You have every right to own your honest preferences and reactions, but do you really want to be in charge of how he processes and expresses his own needs? You have identified an extremely important issue regarding how you two relate. His reaction to stress is to withdraw. Your instinct is to share.

I think you should approach this current phase with an open attitude. Let him take however long it takes for him to process his stress.

Pay attention to the way he comes back to you. Will he choose to discuss the reasons behind his stress and withdrawal? Will he accept your commiseration and comfort? Or will he resurface and simply want to move on?
","It's heartening to hear about the positive reconnection with your old flame after a decade apart. Relationships can be complex, especially when rediscovered after significant personal growth.

Navigating the ebb and flow of communication is crucial in any relationship, especially during challenging times. Your request for open communication and his effort to check in, albeit briefly, show a willingness to meet halfway. It's important to recognize and appreciate that.

Considering his recent job-related stress, it might be beneficial to give him a bit more time to navigate through this difficult period. People cope differently with stress, and while you expressed your need for daily check-ins, he might need some space to process things independently.

However, open and honest communication remains the key. When you feel the time is right, express your feelings calmly and share your perspective. Let him know that you value the check-ins but also crave a deeper connection, especially during challenging times. This will give him insight into your emotional needs while respecting his need for space.

Ultimately, finding a balance that works for both of you is crucial. It's a journey of understanding and compromise, and with the foundation of mutual respect you've described, there's a good chance you can navigate through this challenge together.

Wishing you both the best"
WP," Am I ‘crazy’ for supporting my partner through law school? I’m fine with his decision to change career paths and do something he believes will be more fulfilling. There are just a few issues on my end. He hasn’t told anyone in our families yet and doesn’t want me to say anything to them until he’s accepted into law school. I don’t have any real close friends (that’s a problem for another time since making friends is hard), and I feel like I have no one to talk to about these changes and the potential stress we’re about to face.

Aside from the assumed debt of law school, there’s also the additional burden of our lease ending before him knowing where he wants to go to school. Then there’s the reality that he most likely will not work or will work part-time during his first few semesters (and we live in a relatively expensive city, which means I would most likely foot the bill of many expenses). I’m also anxious about the added stress that law school could put on both of us and our relationship.

Am I absolutely crazy for sticking around for this, especially when we’re not married? He’s my best friend, and I know he’s more than capable of achieving his goals, but I worry I’ll go through these life changes based on his motives without thinking about myself first. Not to mention how much stress it feels could be compounded on my shoulders for the next few years. Keeping my mouth shut has been eating me up inside and I want to feel confident going forward, not just like I’m along for the ride.","Silent & Stressed: I’m sorry you don’t have friends to process all of this with but if I were your friend, I’d ask why you are staying silent and letting it eat you up inside instead of talking to your partner. Especially if he is, as you say, your best friend? Are you afraid of discouraging him or putting a damper on his dreams? Has he asked you how you feel about all of this? If not, this feels like a red flag.

When you are in a committed partnership and you are the one initiating life decisions that affect both people, you have a responsibility to your partner to create an open dialogue to work through the possibilities together. If he wants you to go along for this ride — especially if there’s any expectation of you financially supporting him along the way — he owes you an upfront conversation. Whether his desire is for you to consider relocating with him or to go long-distance, he can’t expect you to agree to a half-baked, under-communicated plan. This lack of communication could be a sign of larger issues, because open communication is vital to any relationship.

However, I imagine that he, too, is experiencing bouts of anxiety about this major life transition. Have you asked him why he isn’t ready to let anyone else in on his law school goals yet? No matter his reasoning, it doesn’t negate your need for more of a support system to help think through all the potential changes ahead.

I know you say the friendship void you’re feeling is a problem for another day but it may be more of a factor here than you think. When your social life outside of your relationship is lacking, the problems within your relationship can seem bigger. In lieu of built-in community, seek out a therapist to work through this with, because if you don’t get it all out, it will continue eating you up inside.

As frustrating as it is to feel left in the dark on so many questions that impact your future, be mindful to not operate on assumption. How do you know that your partner has any expectation of you to step up financially or to even relocate with him? Maybe he plans to take out loans and wants to pursue a long-distance relationship with you. Are you two even on the same page about the future of the relationship? These are all things you have to talk about directly to avoid spinning your wheels unnecessarily.

While he should have initiated these important discussions with you, we can’t deal in “shoulds.” At this point, the ball is in your court. Before approaching him about any of this, it is really important that you get clear on your own goals and desires for the next few years of your life. You won’t get these years back and the reality is you’re not married, so you shouldn’t make moves like someone who is. Take a beat to journal and discuss with your therapist how your partner can support your goals and what you are willing to sacrifice in helping him reach his. Then determine what your non-negotiables are and how to communicate them.

You asked if it’s “crazy” to go along with all of this, and, frankly, it is if you don’t confront all aspects of what this means for you head on. Relationships are about compromise. But it isn’t selfish to think about and prioritize your own desires when negotiating what that compromise looks like — especially before you merge your plans with someone else’s. I hope you two talk it all out and get on the same page ASAP. This constant state of silence and stress is no way to live.","Firstly, let me commend you for being so supportive of your partner's decision to pursue a career change and attend law school. It's a significant life decision that undoubtedly requires a strong support system.

It's completely normal to have reservations and concerns about the practical aspects of this transition. The fact that your partner hasn't shared this decision with family yet might add to the sense of isolation you're feeling. Communication is crucial in any relationship, and it's understandable that you want to share your feelings and concerns.

Before you proceed, have an open and honest conversation with your partner about your worries. Discuss the potential challenges, financial concerns, and the impact on both of your lives. It's essential that both of you are on the same page and can navigate these changes together as a team.

While it's commendable to support your partner, it's equally important to ensure that your needs and concerns are acknowledged. Consider exploring support groups or online communities where you can connect with others who might be in similar situations. Building a network of friends, even if small, can provide you with an outlet to share your experiences and seek advice.

Remember, it's not crazy to prioritize your own well-being and happiness. A healthy relationship involves mutual understanding and support. By addressing your concerns openly and seeking external support, you can navigate this journey together with greater confidence and resilience."
